I'm Brian MacDonald, and this is the place where I keep stuff that I want to be on the web, but is too big for including on socials. It's a blog site, in other words. If you came here looking for professional or serious stuff, you're in the wrong place. These links lead to more official resources about me. MacDonald Editorial , my professional website with my portfolio and services. My Mastodon , pretty much the only social media I bother with anymore. My LinkedIn , for all the usual LinkedIn stuff. What's going on here? I'm verbose. This is a known flaw, known to myself and anyone who's talked to me for more than a few minutes. I often record my thoughts and memories in written form. I'm also fond of \"projects,\" meaning that if I become interested in woozles, I probably won't be happy until I collect all the woozles and write down some thoughts about each. ADHD symptom? Seems likely. At some point, I look at my woozles document and think, \"Oh, gosh, that's 100 pages long now.\" And once I noticed that I had lengthy writing on multiple different topics, I thought I'd put them on a web site, where at least they might persist in some form or be useful to others. Doctor Who Tabletop RPG Adventures I like Doctor Who . Like, a lot. A lot a lot. I also like tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs). There have been attempts at a Doctor Who RPG in the past, but they've faded out over time. The latest attempt is Doctor Who the Roleplaying Game from Cubicle 7 . I stumbled upon it in the fall of 2023, just as the second edition was coming out. I have a weekly RPG group who is often open to trying new things, and which includes some fans of the show, and everybody else is polite and humors me. After running an initial adventure from the rulebook, I started coming up with my own, and I really enjoyed the writing. I'm putting them here in case anybody else wants to run some adventures. Big Finish Pocket Reviews As I mentioned, I'm a huge Doctor Who fan, and have been since the 1980s. But Doctor Who isn't always around, and these days, you get ten episodes and then a two-year pause. Fortunately, Big Finish is there to fill the gaps with audio dramas. They've got full-length, full-cast audio dramas created by amazing writers and directors, some of whom have worked on the TV show, and as many former actors from the show as they can convince to sit in front of a microphone. They're audio stories, sure, but they've got the feel of real Doctor Who , both the classic and the modern series. When I say Big Finish is there to \"fill the gaps,\" I really mean \"stuff as many stories as possible into every possible crack, no matter how small.\" They've been doing their thing since 1999, which has resulted in a massive library of stories. Although Big Finish doesn't restrict themselves to one era or a specific release order, a few years back I decided to listen to as much of the library as I could, in the order the stories take place in the Doctor's personal timeline, or as close as I could determine. Things...got a little out of hand. And of course I had to write down my thoughts, briefly (for me), and that's what you'll find here. Roller Coaster Journal One of my other unusual hobbies is riding roller coasters. There's a whole community of \"coaster enthusiasts\" (what we call ourselves) who love to compare and contrast, collect experiences, and rank things. Oh, do we love to rank things. Rankings are always in flux, so I won't subject you to mine. However, I do like to keep a journal of coasters I've ridden and parks I've visited, because it helps with my later recall. Built with mkdocs.org , because if you're a tech writer and spend all day in Markdown, there's no more natural-feeling static site generator.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#welcome-to-bmacs-nonsense","text":"Hey there.

As a long-time fan of the show, I learned about Big Finish at some point during the \u201cwilderness era,\u201d but they weren\u2019t commonly available in America at the time, so much like the novels, I ignored them. Sometime in 2012, I realized that downloads were available, and I made a few purchases...which I failed to listen to, because I fell asleep while listening. In late 2013, I tried again with the 50th anniversary special, \"A Light at the End.\" Because I was recovering from an injury, the only exercise available to me was walking, so I listened while I walked. That gave me the revelation that the stories are better listened to while doing something that occupies my hands or feet, but not my mind. From that point, I was off to the races. Big Finish has sales quite frequently, and by the time I\u2019m writing this, I\u2019ve acquired all of the Main Range, the Short Trips series, and a good chunk of the Companion Chronicles, as well as the box set specials for a number of the other Doctors. I generally stick to stories in which the Doctor appears, because I have to draw the line somewhere, but I\u2019ve also purchased all the UNIT and River Song sets. I find that I need to have a \u201cproject,\u201d some order in which I\u2019m listening to the stories. I usually listen to new ones right as they come out, but that\u2019s not enough for the amount of listening I do. I can\u2019t just pick stories at random to listen to, unfortunately; maybe it\u2019s a lack of creativity. So a few years back, I listened to everything I own in release order, and that took me about three years to finish. In the first part of 2019, I decided to start over, but listening to the stories in chronological order, according to the Doctor\u2019s timeline, as laid out by Craig Brawley in the Big Finish Listeners Facebook group. However, Mr. Brawley doesn\u2019t include a lot of the Short Trips from before 2018 or so. I had to make my best guesses about where those go. At the end of November 2019, I decided to take a few minutes after each story and write down what I thought. I started with the Fifth Doctor, because he\u2019s my favorite, and because my collection has only a few gaps in his era. After I finished with that, I planned to loop back around to the First Doctor, then jump back to the Sixth, then the Second, and so on. I hope that by the time I get to the eras with more gaps, I\u2019ll have filled them in. I\u2019ll present these reviews in chronological order for the Doctor, but I\u2019ll tag each with the real-world date I wrote the review. That means that for most stories, I\u2019ll write the review shortly after listening to the story, but for the Fifth Doctor, I had to backfill some earlier stories I listened to. I don\u2019t know how long I\u2019ll continue this project; it depends on whether I get bored. Update, November 2025: Clearly, I didn't get bored. Equally clearly, this project accelerated my acquisition of Big Finish stories. I now have almost no gaps anywhere in the Doctor's timeline, and I have complete collections of a number of the spin-off series as well. And because Big Finish never stops, my collection of stories from the modern era has grown to a size I never could have imagined when I started this project.","title":"Big Finish"},{"location":"bigfinish/#big-finish-pocket-reviews","text":"I\u2019m writing this at the end of 2019, and I\u2019ve been a fan of Big Finish Doctor Who for a while now.

Although the Eighth Doctor has a long run in both novels and comics, lasting from his inception in 1996 to the return of the new series in 2005, the bulk of the stories featuring Paul McGann during that period were found on Big Finish, which gives them a bit of extra weight. Unlike the Seventh Doctor stories, Big Finish didn\u2019t try to keep their timeline consistent with the other media (mostly) which allowed them to keep the Doctor\u2019s timeline mostly straight, and avoid the temporal complexities that were going on in the novels. Big Finish also kept going long after the novels and comics had finished, and the Eighth eventually became the first Doctor to see a new TV story (sort of) while his Big Finish adventures were still ongoing, tying this Doctor directly to events created for the new series, specifically the Time War. That gives the Doctor a destination and an arc to his life that had previously been open-ended. As a result of the way Big Finish executed the Eighth Doctor stories, release order runs closer to chronological order than for any other Doctor, although there are exceptions of course. His tenure can also be divided into three large chunks: the early period with Charley, when he was one of several Main Range Doctors, and also considered the \u201ccurrent\u201d Doctor; the middle period with Lucie, in which he became the first Big Finish Doctor to have his own specialized series, influenced by the style and pace of the new series; and the \u201cboxed set\u201d era, in which his adventures tended to be part of large sweeping arc of four boxed sets, each containing four stories. This last era tends to be more tied to new-series concepts and characters, and is still ongoing as I write this.","title":"Eighth Doctor"},{"location":"bigfinish/eighthdoctor/#the-eighth-doctor","text":"The Eighth Doctor, more than any of the others, is largely (but not entirely) an invention of Big Finish.

And it\u2019s kinda fun to see the Slitheen again, but they\u2019re not my favorite new-series villain, and they aren\u2019t used very creatively here. They\u2019re just implacable hunters, a role that could have been filled by a variety of monsters (the unnecessary and obligatory fart joke is all Slitheen, though). But the Slitheen aren\u2019t really the important part; the internal conflict is. And that isn\u2019t really resolved, so the story is a bit dissatisfying on the whole.","title":"Madquake"},{"location":"bigfinish/fifthdoctor/fifthdoctornyssategan/my-dinner-with-andrew/","text":"My Dinner with Andrew The Diary of River Song #3.3 Released: 23 January 2018 Listened: 12/7/19 This is a John Dorney story with an artificial structure, and the timey-wimey turned up to the point where even River gets confused, and I love every second of it.

In this four-parter, after picking up Nyssa, Tegan, and Marc, all of them still on edge, the Doctor promises that they\u2019ll talk, and tries to head for Gallifrey to do so. They end up instead on a planet with a crumbly, spooky sanatorium.

The Doctor seems torn between supporting what they\u2019re trying to do, not supporting them using their powers to make wholesale changes, and appreciating that they\u2019re trying to show restraint and make incremental changes...all up until he sees the chance to save just one person, and upends society in the process. Writer Simon Guerrier seems to have a lot going on in this story, but he keeps it moving, so it doesn\u2019t devolve into a moral debate. He also has to deal with omnipotent characters through the simple expediency of keeping them apart, so the Doctor is with Abby most of the time, and Leela with Zara. The three stories seem to form a complete arc, so there\u2019s no solid ending to this one.","title":"The Garden of Storms"},{"location":"bigfinish/fifthdoctor/fifthdoctorperi2/the-judgement-of-isskar/","text":"The Judgement of Isskar Main Range #117 Released: 22 January 2009 Listened: 12/23/19 The first part of the unfortunately named \u201cKey 2 Time\u201d trilogy, in which, yep, the Key needs to be reassembled by the Grace, the race that created it, because the Doctor messed things up the first time around by using an artificial Sixth Segment.

Erimem gets awfully invested in a religious argument that has nothing to do with her, and once again seems on the verge of breaking with the Doctor and Peri.

Of course, that same research also killed her, and the story never lets you forget it, with Marie\u2019s continual cough, exhausted manner, and terrible stage-fright. The story takes place in America in 1920, when Marie had a national tour. Unfortunately, a scientist named Browman believes that Curie is a fraud riding on her husband\u2019s success, and is determined to discredit her. He also believes that he should have access to the radium that Curie is being gifted with. He\u2019s sexist, which makes sense in an Eighth of March story, but he\u2019s so remarkably foolish and evil that he might as well be twirling his mustache.

These Daleks are a fairly classic bunch; they\u2019re trying to wipe out humanity in 2025 to alter the timeline. Which is a nice reversal of \u201cGenesis of the Daleks,\u201d although 2025 seems a bit early to try it. It\u2019s a fairly straightforward story, as Nick Briggs stories often are, with not much in the way of surprises, but that\u2019s OK.

The action bounces from a village to a castle to London and then to the English fleet and back, so this story likely would have been unfilmable as a TV episode.

It\u2019s a ghost story with a scientific explanation, set in Victorian England, with strong secondary characters. Leela even mentions wanting to see Jago and Litefoot again, but they\u2019re 40 years too early. Plot-wise, it bounces around somewhat, from ghost story to Africa to gods in epic combat, and yet it\u2019s paced quite well, so it doesn\u2019t feel over-long. The origin of the bad guys is never fully explained, nor their motivations, but that\u2019s also appropriate to the era. Leela does pretty well in Africa, better than she did in the Amazon in the last story. She also gets to do a more-than-usual amount of fighting, and isn\u2019t at all hesitant to kill if she thinks it\u2019s warranted. A large component of the story is a macguffin that can heal or even resurrect the dead, which allows for more dramatic cliffhangers in which our main characters actually do die, but cheapens it by making resurrection easy. You\u2019d think there\u2019d be some psychological repercussions to that, but apparently not. Also of note are the bit characters: an unscrupulous poor-house matron, and a pair of body-snatchers that fit the Robert Holmes mode quite nicely.

The casting is very referential: the baddie and his henchman are played by Ian McNeice, not playing Churchill for once, but still unmistakeable, and Gareth Armstrong, who starred in \u201cThe Masque of Mandragora\u201d a very long time ago. Also of note is Daisy Ashford, daughter of Caroline John and Geoffrey Beevers, in a minor role. Leela is certainly exposed to many different aspects of Earth history, but it\u2019s all somewhat random, and leads to her pronouncing \u201cRenaissance\u201d as \u201crunny-science,\u201d which will never not be funny. But it\u2019s clear that she\u2019s starting to get the hang of the Doctor, particularly determining when he\u2019s trying to snow her with technobabble.

The Doctor gets sidelined early on, which gives plenty of focus to Romana, but the actual explanation for his sidelining is laughable. Writer Jonathan Morris is definitely trying to channel some of the Douglas Adams era here, with some overt references, as well as a general sly humor to the dialog. Unfortunately, the \u201cexasperated Romana\u201d persona is in full effect here. Although Romana supposedly regenerated to be more in sync with the Doctor, she sounds annoyed with him most of the time, as though she\u2019s outgrown him. The story takes place at a health spa, where the super-wealthy go to get miraculously thin, but of course there\u2019s something sinister going on with the process. This results in rather a lot of cheap shots about fat people. Although both Romana and the Doctor profess that it doesn\u2019t matter what someone looks like on the outside, it\u2019s clear from Romana\u2019s inner thoughts that she does harbor some prejudice and refuses to acknowledge it. It\u2019s also fairly hypocritical coming from a character who looks like Romana, and especially from someone who can change their physical appearance. On the whole, the story seems rather badly dated, even though it\u2019s only 15 years old, and it caused some cognitive dissonance to listen to it while working out.","title":"The Beautiful People"},{"location":"bigfinish/fourthdoctor/fourthdoctorromana2/the-beautiful-people/#the-beautiful-people","text":"Companion Chronicles #1.4 Released: 19 February 2007 Listened: 6/13/22 Welcome Lalla Ward to the project!

He\u2019s really at his most petulant here, but the story makes the point that he\u2019s never processed his grief for his brother Vash, and both the Doctor and Romana pretty much ignored that. He does get a bit of the \u201cArtful Dodger\u201d act that was supposed to be part of his persona, but rarely showed up. Unfortunately, that can undermine the reader\u2019s trust in him. Romana does a decent job of sticking up for him, but she\u2019s really not experienced at being the big sister, and I\u2019m not sure she\u2019s sorted out her own feelings about Adric. There\u2019s some sci-fi in this story too, with a bodiless entity who feeds on brains, but honestly the resolution to that drags out a bit longer than it should have. Writer Mark Platt knows how to create interesting secondary characters, and there are a bunch of them here, all with their own agendas. It doesn\u2019t leave a ton of room for the plot, though.","title":"Purgatory 12"},{"location":"bigfinish/fourthdoctor/fourthdoctorromanaadric/state-of-decay/","text":"State of Decay TV Season 18, Serial 4 Aired: 22 November 1980 - 13 December 1980 Vampires in E-Space!","title":"State of Decay"},{"location":"bigfinish/fourthdoctor/fourthdoctorromanaadric/state-of-decay/#state-of-decay","text":"TV Season 18, Serial 4 Aired: 22 November 1980 - 13 December 1980 Vampires in E-Space!","title":"State of Decay"},{"location":"bigfinish/fourthdoctor/fourthdoctorromanaadric/the-invasion-of-e-space/","text":"The Invasion of E-Space Companion Chronicles #5.4 Released: 13 October 2010 Listened: 7/16/22 This Companion Chronicle takes place rather late in Romana\u2019s tenure in the TARDIS, when Adric is present, but K-9 isn\u2019t.

The story itself is actually somewhat silly, taking place in Dorset, using Durlston Castle and the stone globe there, but also heavily featuring cyborg dinosaurs. There\u2019s a Jurassic Park vibe, with a mad billionaire and his scientist brother creating the dinosaurs, and of course it goes horribly wrong. The scientist is notably bad with people, and resorts to quipping when he\u2019s nervous, which is most of the story. This allows Polly to exercise her empathy, and take charge in an action-hero way with lots of running. It\u2019s not exactly how Polly was portrayed on TV, but it gives her a good spotlight episode. If you think of it kind of like a new series episode and just roll with the silliness, it\u2019s a lot of good fun, especially because Wills makes the most of it as narrator.","title":"The Curator's Egg"},{"location":"bigfinish/seconddoctor/seconddoctorbenpolly/the-dead-star/","text":"The Dead Star Audio Novels #4 Released: 5 January 2023 Listened: 2/26/23 Big Finish\u2019s audio novels have been all over the place in terms of who they feature. This time, it\u2019s the Second Doctor, Polly, and Ben, shortly before Jamie joins up. It\u2019s narrated by Michael Troughton, who now has the role of the Second Doctor in full-cast stories. I wasn\u2019t too impressed with his version of the Doctor before, but somehow the contrast between his narration voice and his Doctor voice makes him sound more like his father. His secondary characters sometimes sound a bit odd, but they\u2019re consistent, and you get used to them fairly quickly. Like all audio novels, it\u2019s long, but it\u2019s also split into several distinct parts, not unlike \u201cThe Mind Robber.\u201d The first part is in a dimensionally fractured, empty, version of London, which would have been terribly difficult to pull off on TV in 1966, and might even be now. The next chunk takes place in London, 1968, which is a bit odd for Ben and Polly, as it\u2019s two years after they left, but they mostly fit in. This time, the disaster is a small black hole passing through the solar system, which gets hung up on a time corridor that brings it straight toward the Earth. The third chunk takes place on a space station some distance into the future, but it\u2019s more of a realistic station than one would have seen in the 60s. And the last bit is surreal to the point of being indescribable. The story is written by Kate Orman, who wrote several of the Virgin New Adventures novel series, but hasn\u2019t written anything since then; Big Finish were determined to track her down for this series. That background shows in the story, as she pushes the boundaries of the story in ways that go beyond what Big Finish would normally do. She introduces a number of high concepts, such as reconfigurable robots held together by muon fields, and liquid knowledge transfer, which can impart skills and knowledge to anyone, Matrix-like, for a limited period of time. As a result, Polly gets to literally be action-girl, and Ben becomes a physics genius for a bit. There\u2019s also a non-binary character from a human colony where gender simply isn\u2019t considered important, and is referred to with female pronouns in one time period, male ones in another. This does throw Polly and Ben for a loop, but they adjust quickly enough. What\u2019s interesting is that the Doctor really doesn\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on for most of the story. The black hole is a threat, but the underlying reasons remain unknown, so the Doctor spends a lot of time poking at the problem and being frustrated. I don\u2019t normally mention the sound design in Big Finish, but it\u2019s really excellent here, and takes the novel series beyond just an audiobook into creating a real sense of presence. So far, all the novels have been very different in tone, but that\u2019s starting to feel like a feature.","title":"The Dead Star"},{"location":"bigfinish/seconddoctor/seconddoctorbenpolly/the-dead-star/#the-dead-star","text":"Audio Novels #4 Released: 5 January 2023 Listened: 2/26/23 Big Finish\u2019s audio novels have been all over the place in terms of who they feature.

The Doctor has a bit more expository dialog than usual, and sometimes Frazer Hines\u2019 natural accent shows through, but one can overlook that. It\u2019s a fine installment, and the last appearance of Elliot Chapman in this project.","title":"The Morton Legacy"},{"location":"bigfinish/seconddoctor/seconddoctorbenpollyjamie/the-mouthless-dead/","text":"The Mouthless Dead Companion Chronicles #10.1 Released: 23 June 2016 Listened: 9/22/20 This one is a spooky, atmospheric story.

The field affects Jamie\u2019s emotions as well, but not Zoe\u2019s or the Doctor\u2019s. Because it\u2019s told from Zoe\u2019s point of view, we can see her struggling to come to grips with the fact that her friend has a lot of aggression, because his culture required it, and he channels that into protectiveness. In a way, that\u2019s more effective than Jamie trying to examine his own emotions. The story doesn\u2019t mock Jamie, but it also doesn\u2019t elevate him to \u201cnoble savage\u201d status. There\u2019s a bit of a mystery, but not really much of one. At its core, it\u2019s a base-under-siege story, and while it\u2019s not bad, it\u2019s not particularly memorable either.","title":"The Integral"},{"location":"bigfinish/seconddoctor/seconddoctorjamiezoe/the-invasion/","text":"The Invasion TV Season 6, Serial 3 Aired: 2 November 1968 - 21 December 1968 Set on near-future Earth.

It\u2019s a somewhat twisty story, fitting for one set in a Mayan temple, but how much you enjoy it depends on whether you want a Second Doctor story or a modern-series-ish story.","title":"The Tactics of Defeat"},{"location":"bigfinish/seconddoctor/seconddoctorjamiezoe/the-uncertainty-principle/","text":"The Uncertainty Principle Companion Chronicles #7.2 Released: August 2012 Listened: 10/18/20 This is one of the Companion Chronicles that\u2019s linked to several others (like Steven\u2019s trilogy following \u201cThe Savages,\u201d or Sarah Kingdom\u2019s trilogy), and the frame stories go in a different chronological order than the flashbacks (most of them written by Simon Guerrier).

The planet Nineveh has been attacked by something called the Shroud, which blocks off their sun, and any form of artificial light as well. That\u2019s bad news for the human colony there, but an interesting twist for audio, as the characters spend a while in total darkness. It seems like a simple case of alien invasion, but of course all is not what it seems. The mystery isn\u2019t exactly a ton of mystery, although it is a story that\u2019s specific to Time Lords, so that\u2019s good. Writer Boy Ayers is another new Big Finish writer, and he seems more interested in the high concepts than the specifics of the plot.

So we have a team-up with the Brigadier, against the Ice Warriors. This Brigadier is from roughly the same point in time as the Doctor, so he hasn\u2019t seen Ice Warriors, has never seen the TARDIS, and knows nothing about regeneration. (This explains, in part, why the Brigadier seems to know a bit more about the Doctor than he should when the Third Doctor\u2019s era begins.) Andrew Smith is the writer, but he doesn\u2019t really lean into his usual \u201cbad guy isn\u2019t actually evil\u201d approach, at least not in the main. The story is set in Scotland, and Lucie Goldie provides a lovely Scots accent as temporary companion Sheena Flynn. John Culshaw plays the Brigadier with his usual skill, and the surprise guest for this one is Katy Manning playing Ice Warrior royalty. She somehow straddles the line of doing a perfect Ice Warrior while still managing to sound like Katy Manning, which may not have been what they were going for. Michael Troughton is slightly more comfortable in this story, at times sounding quite a bit like his father. Where the story really excels is capturing the Second Doctor\u2019s essential \u201cDoctor-ness,\u201d the qualities that have informed just about every actor since: His curiosity, his flippancy at inappropriate times, his willingness to laugh at authority, and the confidence he exhibits when he\u2019s found the answers. The moments when he gets the Brigadier\u2019s call sign wrong (intentionally? who knows?) are a beautiful encapsulation of their relationship. The actual resolution of the plot is a bit of a let-down, because it\u2019s been done too many times before.

I suspect the adaptations are a lot more palatable if you were fond of the original novels. Unfortunately, I sat out most of the wilderness years, and quit reading after the first couple of novels.

One thing that\u2019s constant is that Ace isn\u2019t happy to see Benny, and she\u2019s being particularly insistent that this planet should not be rescued. That\u2019s pretty unlike Ace, but because we\u2019re getting the story from Benny\u2019s point of view, it never becomes clear. I have no idea how Guy Adams wrote this without going mad, and it definitely takes a good amount of concentration to listen to. There\u2019s a good slap-in-the-face climax, but there isn\u2019t really a resolution as such. If it were a standalone, that would seem like a disappointing ending. As a cliffhanger, it makes you wonder if 49 minutes were really necessary to get to this point.

And although Hex does deserve proper remembrance, you can\u2019t fill a whole four-part story with a funeral, so there must also be alien goings-on in Liverpool that Ace stumbles into. Specifically, there\u2019s Hector Thomas, a mob leader in the guise of a \u201csuccessful club owner\u201d who\u2019s a dead ringer for Hex, but has none of his memories or personality. And his mob rivals aren\u2019t just otherworldly, they\u2019re Elder Gods, yet again, which explains how they\u2019ve revived Hex. You\u2019d think the Doctor might have learned from his recent experiences, but he takes down the gods rather easily, while giving an \u201cI am the Doctor\u201d speech that would do Steven Moffat proud. The gods part isn\u2019t really what\u2019s important; it\u2019s the semi-resolution for Ace and Hex, and to a lesser extent, Sally. From an emotional perspective, it gets the job done.","title":"Afterlife"},{"location":"bigfinish/seventhdoctor/seventhdoctoracehex/black-and-white/","text":"Black and White Main Range #163 Released: 16 August 2012 Listened: 1/9/21 At last we come to the story we\u2019ve been building to since Scutari , and the answers to some lingering questions.

Because we\u2019re not seeing the main characters closely this time, there\u2019s no way to tell what they\u2019re thinking, so we don\u2019t know if the Doctor was being particularly manipulative, or if the companions were in on the plan this time. It\u2019s a pretty dark story, though, which is going to become a theme in this part of the era. It\u2019s memorable because of the unusual format, but it\u2019s also a decent story as well.","title":"LIVE 34"},{"location":"bigfinish/seventhdoctor/seventhdoctoracehex/lurkers-at-sunlights-edge/","text":"Lurkers at Sunlight's Edge Main Range #141 Released: 15 November 2010 Listened: 1/1/21 After two stories that connected deeply with the histories of the Doctor and his companions, this one...doesn\u2019t do that, at all.

They\u2019re still in the White TARDIS, and in this case, without the Doctor, which leads to a resolution in the next story. On an entirely different level, it\u2019s a deeply unsettling story, because Ace and Hex have landed in an alternate 1989, in a world that\u2019s much closer to nuclear war than the real one ever got. They end up sheltering with an elderly couple, Albert and Peggy, which is a straight reference to the 1986 animated film When the Wind Blows . This is one of the stories that hits me personally: As a child of the 1980s, I remember the threat of nuclear war, and the absurd futility of trying to do anything about it.

They\u2019re still in the White TARDIS, and in this case, without the Doctor, which leads to a resolution in the next story. On an entirely different level, it\u2019s a deeply unsettling story, because Ace and Hex have landed in an alternate 1989, in a world that\u2019s much closer to nuclear war than the real one ever got. They end up sheltering with an elderly couple, Albert and Peggy, which is a straight reference to the 1986 animated film When the Wind Blows . This is one of the stories that hits me personally: As a child of the 1980s, I remember the threat of nuclear war, and the absurd futility of trying to do anything about it.

It\u2019s a rather low-stakes story about a ship that encounters the Flying Dutchman , and the threat that poses to the crew -- no elder gods, or fate of the universe, and in contrast to the last couple of stories, it\u2019s not dark at all. The Doctor is a little bit inscrutable, but again, the stakes are low; he\u2019s just offering Ace and Hex a puzzle to work on. The secondary characters are fairly one-note; there\u2019s an insecure new captain, and a bunch of crewmen who sound like pirates, and are rather easily swayed.

It\u2019s a strong start, very deliberate and appropriate for a new companion. The first episode is squarely from Hex\u2019s POV, so you get to see how he gets involved in the Doctor\u2019s world and tries to adapt. He\u2019s determined, if inexperienced, and contributes some good ideas to the plan. He\u2019s also got a strong personality, and he\u2019s big on the empathy; you can see a good chunk of Hex in Rory Williams. The story itself is part of a trilogy with \u201c The Reaping \u201d and \u201c The Gathering ,\u201d but this was the first of the stories produced, so the others aren\u2019t required listening for this. Ace says she\u2019s been with the Doctor a surprisingly long time, and she\u2019s definitely shifted in attitude here. She\u2019s not necessarily the military veteran from the novels, but she\u2019s more confident and independent, a partner to the Doctor. She very easily falls into the \u201cbig sister\u201d role with Hex, and seems to be encouraging him to take on the companion role, if not directly. As for the Doctor, he\u2019s not entirely inscrutable, but he\u2019s certainly up for a big morality speech, especially when the Cybermen are involved. The story comes close to another temporal phenomenon: Although it was recorded and released in 2004, it\u2019s set in 2021. The European Union is said to be influential in Britain\u2019s affairs, but I think we can forgive Big Finish for not anticipating Brexit. The only major technical anachronism is System, the AI that runs the hospital where Hex works, but that\u2019s stated in \u201cThe Gathering\u201d to be the product of alien technology. The TV series fell into that trap a few times, usually in stories involving the Cybermen. It\u2019s reasonable to assume that Big Finish wasn\u2019t anticipating still being around in 2021, nor the return of the show to TV and its subsequent popularity.

The Doctor is pretty disappointed, as she hoped that Mel would influence Glitz, not the other way around. However, not all is as it appears, as Mel may have been running a con on Glitz for charitable purposes. Mel still seems to have all her tech skills, and some additional experience besides, but she\u2019s surprised at how well Ace enacts the Doctor\u2019s plans now, and how morally righteous the Doctor seems to have become. The heist part of the story is pretty well put together, but once the layers are peeled away, the actual baddies, tentacled creatures who eat people\u2019s quantum futures, aren\u2019t all that impressive. Plus they\u2019ve got that annoying slurpy voice effect that slavering creatures tend to have in Big Finish. Mel comes along at the end of the story, which Ace doesn\u2019t seem to be wholly excited about. Incidentally, this story is clearly post-Hex for Ace, as it comes directly after \u201c You Are the Doctor ,\u201d which follows \u201c Signs and Wonders ,\u201d but the actors seem a bit fuzzy about that in the extras. It\u2019s a good start to Mel\u2019s return era.","title":"A Life of Crime"},{"location":"bigfinish/seventhdoctor/seventhdoctoracemel/come-die-with-me/","text":"Come Die with Me Main Range #207 Released: 16 September 2015 Listened: 1/17/21 This entry isn\u2019t quite as clever as the previous one.

Mel\u2019s debts from \u201c A Life of Crime \u201d are still outstanding, and are now owned by Josiah Dogbolter, a frog-like capitalist mostly from the comics, but who has appeared in \u201c The Maltese Penguin .\u201d He\u2019s also now President of the Solar System, a fairly obvious nod to American politics in 2018. He demands that Mel bring him the TARDIS, and she does, by betraying the Doctor and Ace. Mel thinks she can steal it right back, but because it\u2019s a time machine, Dogbolter manages to provide the technology to his younger self, enabling him to create a bubble around the solar system in which he can control probability to provide himself the best outcome. This abuse of Gallifreyan technology attracts the attention of Narvin, usually seen in the Gallifrey series, giving him the opportunity to meet Ace for the first time. The Doctor, Ace, and Narvin get written out pretty early, brainwashed and forced to live other lives on Earth. That leaves Mel to spend a bunch of time with Hob, Dogbolter\u2019s robot assistant, who\u2019s got a rather slimy, evil laugh, for a robot. In the middle of all this, there\u2019s an invasion going on that Dogbolter can\u2019t stop, from a group of aliens obsessed with media and public perception. Which actually makes them pretty easy to defeat, because the Seventh Doctor is expert at manipulating perceptions. Mel gets some character growth here, or at least gets to behave other than sunny and chipper, and reveals just how dangerous her hacking skills can be. Sylvester McCoy and Sophie Aldred get the fun of playing different versions of their usual characters. And the guest voices, Toby Longworth, Wayne Forester, and Jules de Jongh, are all hamming it up tremendously, but the story calls for that. The first time I heard this, I was expecting a full resolution of Mel\u2019s story, and while one phase of it seems to be resolved, she doesn\u2019t leave or anything.

Mel\u2019s debts from \u201c A Life of Crime \u201d are still outstanding, and are now owned by Josiah Dogbolter, a frog-like capitalist mostly from the comics, but who has appeared in \u201c The Maltese Penguin .\u201d He\u2019s also now President of the Solar System, a fairly obvious nod to American politics in 2018. He demands that Mel bring him the TARDIS, and she does, by betraying the Doctor and Ace. Mel thinks she can steal it right back, but because it\u2019s a time machine, Dogbolter manages to provide the technology to his younger self, enabling him to create a bubble around the solar system in which he can control probability to provide himself the best outcome. This abuse of Gallifreyan technology attracts the attention of Narvin, usually seen in the Gallifrey series, giving him the opportunity to meet Ace for the first time. The Doctor, Ace, and Narvin get written out pretty early, brainwashed and forced to live other lives on Earth. That leaves Mel to spend a bunch of time with Hob, Dogbolter\u2019s robot assistant, who\u2019s got a rather slimy, evil laugh, for a robot. In the middle of all this, there\u2019s an invasion going on that Dogbolter can\u2019t stop, from a group of aliens obsessed with media and public perception. Which actually makes them pretty easy to defeat, because the Seventh Doctor is expert at manipulating perceptions. Mel gets some character growth here, or at least gets to behave other than sunny and chipper, and reveals just how dangerous her hacking skills can be. Sylvester McCoy and Sophie Aldred get the fun of playing different versions of their usual characters. And the guest voices, Toby Longworth, Wayne Forester, and Jules de Jongh, are all hamming it up tremendously, but the story calls for that. The first time I heard this, I was expecting a full resolution of Mel\u2019s story, and while one phase of it seems to be resolved, she doesn\u2019t leave or anything. It\u2019s also somewhat goofy for a story that\u2019s supposed to carry dramatic weight, so it\u2019s good that it wasn\u2019t an ending.

The year is 2085, meaning this story takes place shortly after \u201c Warriors of the Deep ,\u201d and the political factions from that story are still in place. Some Silurians have woken up early, as they do, and they have records not only of \u201cWarriors,\u201d but also of \u201c The Silurans \u201d and the Doctor\u2019s history going back to \u201c Bloodtide .\u201d Although this story was released well after \u201cThe Hungry Earth,\u201d those events aren\u2019t mentioned. It follows the usual pattern for Silurian stories, with the Silurians assuming that humans are dangerous and taking steps to get rid of them, in this case replacing a high-level human politician with a mind-controlled plant. There\u2019s some misdirection as to who the plant is, but it\u2019s so blatant that it\u2019s easy to assume that the story will pull a fast one, except it doesn\u2019t. Ace spends most of the story angry at the Doctor for being so secretive, and Mel spends it mostly confused, because the Doctor she remembers usually didn\u2019t act like that (except for Pompeii ). This leaves Ace pretty much stuck on one note, and although Mel spends some time being introspective, it doesn\u2019t really add up to much. Nicholas Asbury plays an Australian with an accent so thick it\u2019s almost a parody, and Caitlin Thorburn plays a series of robots with an American accent that sounds a lot like Nicola Bryant\u2019s.

And the Doctor is at his most enigmatic, disappearing without warning, making strange observations, and even putting on his \u201cfacing down an Elder God\u201d act, with a nice twist. The whole story, in fact, has a nice twist that I didn\u2019t see coming, so that\u2019s refreshing. On the whole, I liked this boxed set better than I expected to. I\u2019m not a huge fan of the novel era, but these stories were a nice mix of older characters with a more modern twist.

Will does somewhat better this time out, taking some action on his own to sneak around the base and ingratiate himself with his captors after his cover is inevitably blown, but he\u2019s tripped up by his lack of experience with the broader universe, which is hardly surprising. There\u2019s some unnecessary run-around in the middle which drags a bit, but the last part is pretty sharp. There\u2019s some misdirection that drives the larger plot into the next story, but this story, even though it\u2019s a diversion, turns out to be a better middle part than they usually are.","title":"Starlight Robbery"},{"location":"bigfinish/seventhdoctor/seventhdoctorklein/survival-of-the-fittest/","text":"Survival of the Fittest Main Range #131 Released: 18 February 2010 Listened: 3/9/21 Although this is the second story on this disc, when it opens, several other adventures are mentioned, so clearly some time has passed.

She\u2019s got the Doctor prisoner, but this version of him doesn\u2019t remember traveling with her, or so he says. She can\u2019t manage to get back to her original timeline (the TARDIS won\u2019t go there), so she\u2019s been building a Fourth Reich of her own in the future, continually doubling back on herself to fix mistakes, but never seeming to get it entirely right.

Big Finish had done a set of UNIT stories in 2004-2005, without the Doctor (but with David Tennant, oddly). This 2012 box was meant to be a continuation of that series, but featuring the Doctor, and unfortunately without Nicholas Courtney, who had passed away by this time. Klein is the primary UNIT character, which is a bit odd, because the story takes place in the 1990s, and Klein was active in the 1960s. Then this all got set aside a few years later as Big Finish got the license for new-series UNIT. Alex MacQueen appears in this story as a future Doctor, which was an effective trick if you were hearing it for the first time when it came out. However, he then played the Master (quite effectively) several times over the next few years, so the effect is spoiled, much like when Rufus Hound appears as the Monk in disguise, in \u201c The Black Hole .\u201d As the Doctor, though, he does a decent job of imitating the Doctor\u2019s quirkiness, but with a streak of ruthlessness that Klein actually admires, even though she doesn\u2019t trust him. His Master portrayal is similar to the last few TV Masters, especially Sacha Dhawan, in that he seems normal, even cunning for a bit, and then is equally likely to explode into shouting or giggles. On top of that, the Doctor\u2019s companion is Rayne Creevey , and Ace is stated to be on Gallifrey. It\u2019s not clear exactly why Rayne, and why now, especially since the Doctor is specifically portrayed as older. However, I like Beth Chalmers, and I like Rayne, so I\u2019m not complaining. Rayne does complain rather a bit, though; seeing a \u201cfuture Doctor\u201d who doesn\u2019t appear to remember her makes her think that she\u2019s fated to die in this story, which tends to make companions act oddly, and isn\u2019t particularly endearing. The story itself is pretty bizarre too. The \u201cDoctor\u201d turns up at UNIT to get a dimensional thingy, and ends up forced to help them out because there are multiple dimensional incursions going on around Earth. Meanwhile, the Doctor and Rayne are stuck dealing with an incursion elsewhere, and spend the first two stories just getting to Earth. UNIT, meanwhile, deals with energy vampires, then mind leeches, then giant floating heads (who turn out to be helpful), then giant spiders that spit lava...it\u2019s like the writers (Nick Briggs and Jason Arnopp) took \u201cother dimension\u201d as a cue to upend their \u201cbizarre aliens idea drawer\u201d all over this story. UNIT, unfortunately, acts less like the UNIT we know, and more like a generic military force from the show. The British leaders are pretty much incompetent (the American and Japanese leaders we meet briefly are better), and Klein is the only voice of reason, but she has major trust issues with the Doctor, so she\u2019s not a reliable ally. As for Klein herself, there are hints that she has some vague memories of her alternate life, and the Master is more than happy to tell her about it, but as far as this story is concerned, that only results in her distrusting the Doctor, who really handled the situation very poorly. Once the big twist is revealed at the end of Part 3, it goes downhill somewhat, as the Master and the Doctor spend a lot of time talking at each other...well, gloating, on the Master\u2019s part, but he does like a good gloat. Ultimately, the ending doesn\u2019t hold up the epic nature of the rest of the story, but introducing a new Master, establishing the new Klein, bringing back Rayne, and all the wacky ideas give this a thumbs up.","title":"UNIT: Dominion"},{"location":"bigfinish/seventhdoctor/seventhdoctorklein/unit-dominion/#unit-dominion","text":"Special Released: 23 October 2012 Listened: 3/13/21 This story is weird: in its purpose, its place in continuity, and the story itself.

The station\u2019s crew (which is mostly a doctor and a science officer) are strangely incompetent, even for parodies.

This isn\u2019t one that the listener can try to figure out; you\u2019re just along for the ride. The Doctor is still mangling proverbs, and Mel directly asks him to stop. In fact, Mel seems a lot less pleased with the Doctor in this story. Maybe it\u2019s the way he keeps forgetting about her.

It\u2019s a send-up of the Eurovision Song Contest, and Star Trek , specifically Deep Space Nine . Mel and the Doctor end up on the station where the song contest is taking place, among a tricky political situation, and are immediately mistaken for the new commander and his aide, which the Doctor goes along with. The station\u2019s crew (which is mostly a doctor and a science officer) are strangely incompetent, even for parodies. There\u2019s a murder mystery going on, but the Doctor is oddly reticent to discuss it, and lets Mel continually leap to outlandish conclusions. This isn\u2019t one that the listener can try to figure out; you\u2019re just along for the ride. The Doctor is still mangling proverbs, and Mel directly asks him to stop. In fact, Mel seems a lot less pleased with the Doctor in this story. Maybe it\u2019s the way he keeps forgetting about her.

On top of which, one of the groups of aliens has kidnapped Flip from her wedding in 2012 and brought her to 1948 to use as leverage.

This story, though, hinges on the point that they\u2019re really not the same. They\u2019re in France, in 1944, as the occupation is ending, and the Doctor states bluntly that this is somewhere Constance shouldn\u2019t be, mostly because of the potential to damage her timeline. However, Constance is carrying around a lot of hatred towards the Nazis, which is somewhat understandable for a person actively participating in WWII, but Flip can\u2019t bring herself around to Constance\u2019s way of thinking, and they disagree when they witness a French collaborator being punished. It\u2019s not a true historical, though, and there\u2019s a creature who feeds on hate, of which there\u2019s rather a lot to go around in this time and place.

Somewhere else turns out to be a riff on Old Man\u2019s War , because they\u2019re locked into powered armor and forced to fight in a war. This scenario splits up the three travelers fairly quickly, giving them a range of other people to interact with. The Doctor confronts his pacifism (for a bit), Constance gets to use her organizational skills (if not her codebreaking ones), and Flip gets a physical adventure, although she\u2019s still a bit more restrained than she had been in previous stories.

Somewhere else turns out to be a riff on Old Man\u2019s War , because they\u2019re locked into powered armor and forced to fight in a war. This scenario splits up the three travelers fairly quickly, giving them a range of other people to interact with. The Doctor confronts his pacifism (for a bit), Constance gets to use her organizational skills (if not her codebreaking ones), and Flip gets a physical adventure, although she\u2019s still a bit more restrained than she had been in previous stories.

The two stories really only have one thing in common, but it\u2019s a big thing: The sole surviving Dalek being held prisoner by humans, and the Doctor encountering it in a dark room. I have to say that Christopher Eccleston played that scene better than Colin Baker did, but the Sixth Doctor is merely encountering his nemesis, whereas the Ninth Doctor has all the weight of the Time War to deal with, meeting a scourge he thought was gone forever. For the rest, though, the humans in this story are remarkably stupid and insane, even the ones who are just pretending to be stupid for nefarious purposes. Evelyn gets the part that Rose played, of the companion who believes a Dalek can be redeemed, even when the Doctor doesn\u2019t. The resolution, though, is dramatically different, with a big chunk of timey-wimey that\u2019s never adequately explained. It leads to a couple of Daleks shouting philosophy at one another, which doesn\u2019t make a ton of sense, and the Doctor speechifying on the dark side of human nature, which is a bit over the top.

Plus David Troughton appears in a minor role. There\u2019s also a bit where Menzies pretends to be the Doctor, and various characters react to the idea that the Doctor could be a woman. The pacing in this story is very frantic, starting in media res and never really letting up. It definitely shows the influence of the modern series on the Main Range, more than previous Evelyn stories. As for the plot, you wouldn\u2019t think there\u2019d be any room for it, and there isn\u2019t a ton, but as usual, Brewster is doing some very shady things for what appears to be the right reasons. His happy ending from \u201c A Perfect World \u201d is lost to him, and he\u2019s engaging in reckless behavior as a result. There\u2019s some hive-mind aliens, and a question of whether it\u2019s appropriate to sacrifice one planet to save another. Brewster ends up tagging along with the Doctor and Evelyn, although he\u2019s finding the Sixth Doctor to be rather less tolerant of him than the Fifth was.","title":"The Crimes of Thomas Brewster"},{"location":"bigfinish/sixthdoctor/sixthdoctorevelyn/the-feast-of-axos/","text":"The Feast of Axos Main Range #144 Released: February 2011 Listened: 6/26/20 This story is much less frenetic than the last one, and also leans further into Brewster\u2019s character.

Flip is the first \u201cmodern day\u201d companion to meet Jago and Litefoot, and her reaction to them is a lot more fun than Leela\u2019s or Romana\u2019s, who take them at face value. Flip leans more on the pop-cultural references than usual this time out, name-checking both Star Wars and Harry Potter at different points, to the Doctor\u2019s consternation. Her characteristic fearlessness is put to good use within the plot, as we find out there\u2019s one thing she is afraid of: performing on stage. The Valeyard is also full of references and foreshadowing as well, even hinting at Flip\u2019s destiny, which we\u2019ll see before too long. Although it\u2019s a little self-indulgent, I think this is one of the more enjoyable stories in this part of the project.","title":"Stage Fright"},{"location":"bigfinish/sixthdoctor/sixthdoctorflip/the-brood-of-erys/","text":"The Brood of Erys Main Range #183 Released: 14 February 2014 Listened: 8/15/20 This story is also by a classic-series writer, this time Andrew Smith.

Unfortunately, the parts don\u2019t really add up to a coherent story, as the high concepts don\u2019t connect as well as you might think. There\u2019s also some pacing difficulties. Because a rocket to the moon takes three days to arrive, the plot has to skip rather abruptly over the stretches where nothing happens. It\u2019s also got rather a high body count, but that\u2019s a Sixth Doctor story for you.

However, it\u2019s 2163, which means it\u2019s several years after the Daleks invaded Earth, and still at least a year before the First Doctor will show up to stop them , which means that the Sixth Doctor can\u2019t do much to affect the course of events. Or so it seems, anyway. The Doctor is perfectly willing to bend the rules when one of his friends is in danger, and while he seems a bit aloof at the start of the story, to Peri\u2019s annoyance, once she\u2019s in trouble, he\u2019ll stop at nothing to save her, Web of Time or no Web of Time. For her part, although Peri is under the influence for a fair chunk of the story, her characterization is more mature, less panicky, and a bit more world-weary. There\u2019s also a vein of caution, as though she\u2019s not entirely sure she trusts this Doctor, which is appropriate. Oddly, although the Doctor is quite strident while he\u2019s trying to save Peri, when he\u2019s verbally sparring with the Daleks, he\u2019s casual, even flippant.

However, it\u2019s 2163, which means it\u2019s several years after the Daleks invaded Earth, and still at least a year before the First Doctor will show up to stop them , which means that the Sixth Doctor can\u2019t do much to affect the course of events. Or so it seems, anyway. The Doctor is perfectly willing to bend the rules when one of his friends is in danger, and while he seems a bit aloof at the start of the story, to Peri\u2019s annoyance, once she\u2019s in trouble, he\u2019ll stop at nothing to save her, Web of Time or no Web of Time. For her part, although Peri is under the influence for a fair chunk of the story, her characterization is more mature, less panicky, and a bit more world-weary. There\u2019s also a vein of caution, as though she\u2019s not entirely sure she trusts this Doctor, which is appropriate. Oddly, although the Doctor is quite strident while he\u2019s trying to save Peri, when he\u2019s verbally sparring with the Daleks, he\u2019s casual, even flippant.

Group Captain Gilmore in particular seems out of his depth much of the time, and although Dr. Jensen is clearly the science-capable member of the team, her role gets downplayed, in accordance with the times. Sir Toby Kinsella, the one character who isn\u2019t from \u201c Remembrance of the Daleks ,\u201d seems to be the most decisive of the lot. As it is, they spend a lot of time reacting in this story, and carefully putting together a pretty basic mystery that the Doctor would likely have jumped right to the end of.

The Doctor states several times that he agrees with the goal, but not the means. The Doctor is also in conflict with various military figures throughout the story, in a way that\u2019s consistent for him, but usually wasn\u2019t quite so sharply drawn at this point in the show\u2019s history. As is typical with a six-part story, the first part zips right along, and the middle bogs down. There\u2019s even a sequence where the Doctor and Jo break out of a prison cell, go do a thing, fail, and have to break back into the same prison cell before anybody notices they\u2019re gone, so that\u2019s a bit frustrating. The part-three cliffhanger of the British Prime Minister getting vaporized live on TV certainly grabs the attention, though. Katy Manning and Richard Franklin take turns with the narration, which means Manning gets most of the Doctor\u2019s lines.","title":"The Mega"},{"location":"bigfinish/thirddoctor/thirddoctorjo/the-mind-of-evil/","text":"The Mind of Evil TV Season 8, Serial 2 Aired: 30 January 1971 - 6 March 1971 This is the season where the Master appears in every story (which Terrence Dicks admits was overkill).

This is the one we\u2019ve been waiting for, where River meets the Third Doctor along with the Brig, Liz, and a special guest star at the end. The Third Doctor, especially this early in his tenure, despises being pushed around, and really hates anyone touching his stuff, which is exactly what River\u2019s been doing for weeks now, having sent him off on a wild goose chase. So the expected shouting scene ensues, and while Tim Treloar does an excellent Third Doctor, he\u2019s not always at his best when shouting. Because this is River\u2019s story, she handles him the way she always does: does her own thing and expects him to trail along behind, being irritated. This time, though, she really does know what\u2019s going on, and has most of a plan to fix it. Basically because it\u2019s her fault. There\u2019s some alien tech down a mine, and it\u2019s awfully dangerous, so she needs to get it back. The plot stays pretty basic so there\u2019s more time for banter, but there are some fairly well-drawn secondary characters, and a nice visual of subterranean lightning. There\u2019s a little bit of dodgy science mixing up gravity and magnetism, but it\u2019s forgivable. There\u2019s also a nice throwaway line about some time fluctuations messing up the entire decade, which is cute.

The Third Doctor, especially this early in his tenure, despises being pushed around, and really hates anyone touching his stuff, which is exactly what River\u2019s been doing for weeks now, having sent him off on a wild goose chase. So the expected shouting scene ensues, and while Tim Treloar does an excellent Third Doctor, he\u2019s not always at his best when shouting. Because this is River\u2019s story, she handles him the way she always does: does her own thing and expects him to trail along behind, being irritated. This time, though, she really does know what\u2019s going on, and has most of a plan to fix it. Basically because it\u2019s her fault. There\u2019s some alien tech down a mine, and it\u2019s awfully dangerous, so she needs to get it back. The plot stays pretty basic so there\u2019s more time for banter, but there are some fairly well-drawn secondary characters, and a nice visual of subterranean lightning. There\u2019s a little bit of dodgy science mixing up gravity and magnetism, but it\u2019s forgivable. There\u2019s also a nice throwaway line about some time fluctuations messing up the entire decade, which is cute. Liz kind of takes a back seat this time, but does demonstrate considerable trust in River, which built over the stories. As a boxed set, it works quite well, and this story provides the ending you\u2019d expect.","title":"Rivers of Light"},{"location":"bigfinish/thirddoctor/thirddoctorliz/shadow-of-the-past/","text":"Shadow of the Past Companion Chronicles #4.9 Released: 30 April 2010 Listened: 5/25/21 Finally, we get a story featuring Caroline John as Liz. This story is by Simon Guerrier, who knows how to twist a plot, and it really uses the Companion Chronicles structure well. An older Liz has returned to UNIT to follow up on an investigation that she was part of in the 1970s. There\u2019s a soldier there on guard, so she ends up telling him the story of what happened originally. The writing for the Doctor is strong, as it often is. It takes advantage of the fact that this is early in the Third Doctor\u2019s life, so he\u2019s feeling frustrated at being stuck on Earth, and his relationship with the Brigadier is still forming, so he\u2019s more likely to act on his own and disobey orders without explaining. The story takes a while to get rolling, appropriate for this era, but once the enemy is revealed as a Mim (a race of shapeshifters who don\u2019t turn up too often), there\u2019s a typical UNIT response, with an unfortunately high body count. Part of the shapeshifting shenanigans hinges on the fact that Liz doesn\u2019t really know the Doctor all that well, which wouldn\u2019t have worked as well with Jo. Liz also comments on changes in UNIT procedure since the original event (having an HQ in London, for example), which positions it nicely in Season 7. The plot twist isn\u2019t too hard to figure out, but it does wrap up nicely.

It lacks the characteristic pauses and drawing out of words that Patrick did.

Daisy Ashford, Caroline John\u2019s daughter, played Liz in \u201cPrimord,\u201d but in this story she has a larger role. It\u2019s also the first story in which the Doctor, the Brigadier, and Liz are all played by recast actors, meaning all of the main characters are recast. Big Finish has built very slowly and respectfully to this point, and the audience seems to have accepted that. And for the most part, Daisy Ashford, Tim Treloar, and John Culshaw are all believable as the characters they play. Even listening to them in the middle of this project, you can quickly accept them as the real thing. As for the story, it\u2019s reasonable, and mostly a product of its time. There\u2019s an alien race who wants to invade, and of course they start by trying to take over Britain. They do so by mind-controlling large chunks of the military, in the guise of a training program, which of course includes some UNIT officers. Which raises the question of why Benton and Yates aren\u2019t in this story, but having their original actors might make things awkward. That leaves the Doctor, the Brig, and Liz on the run for a large chunk of the story, with no one to turn to for help, which neatly explains the smallish cast. Not much that happens in the story is particularly surprising, but some of the casting is. Sergeant Nicki Attah is the main non-commissioned UNIT member, and no matter how enlightened UNIT was in 1970, having a black woman in charge of the troops seems a bit forward.

Daisy Ashford, Caroline John\u2019s daughter, played Liz in \u201cPrimord,\u201d but in this story she has a larger role. It\u2019s also the first story in which the Doctor, the Brigadier, and Liz are all played by recast actors, meaning all of the main characters are recast. Big Finish has built very slowly and respectfully to this point, and the audience seems to have accepted that. And for the most part, Daisy Ashford, Tim Treloar, and John Culshaw are all believable as the characters they play. Even listening to them in the middle of this project, you can quickly accept them as the real thing. As for the story, it\u2019s reasonable, and mostly a product of its time. There\u2019s an alien race who wants to invade, and of course they start by trying to take over Britain. They do so by mind-controlling large chunks of the military, in the guise of a training program, which of course includes some UNIT officers. Which raises the question of why Benton and Yates aren\u2019t in this story, but having their original actors might make things awkward. That leaves the Doctor, the Brig, and Liz on the run for a large chunk of the story, with no one to turn to for help, which neatly explains the smallish cast. Not much that happens in the story is particularly surprising, but some of the casting is. Sergeant Nicki Attah is the main non-commissioned UNIT member, and no matter how enlightened UNIT was in 1970, having a black woman in charge of the troops seems a bit forward. The two primary agents of the invading aliens are also women, all of which is good casting, but doesn\u2019t necessarily fit with the period it\u2019s set in. Still, I support this kind of casting; there\u2019s no need to be bound by the period in which the show is set.

Instead, it\u2019s read by Richard Franklin, and features Mike Yates, who\u2019s an RAF lieutenant at the start of the story. This marks his first appearance, and includes his first encounter with UNIT, causing him to join up (he doesn\u2019t appear in Season 7; he\u2019s just present at the start of next season). It\u2019s part of the \u201cDestiny of the Doctor\u201d series, so the remit for Andrew Smith is to tell a very typical Third Doctor story, which this mostly is. A number of stone circles in Scotland are acting strangely, and of course it\u2019s aliens who\u2019ve been hibernating on Earth for thousands of years, trying to phone home. The Doctor investigates, and ends up trying to broker peace between the soldiers and the aliens, but as usual, it doesn\u2019t quite come off. The aliens aren\u2019t entirely blameless here, as they view the humans as hopelessly primitive, and seem not to recognize the 4000 years of advancement. The aliens are played by Trevor Littledale, one of my favorite Big Finish actors, so I\u2019m inclined to trust them, but sadly it doesn\u2019t play out that way. As far as that part of the plot goes, it\u2019s pretty standard. Mike Yates gets a lot of the focus, though, showing intelligence, bravery, and local knowledge. Best of all, he keeps his cool in the face of danger, and he trusts the Doctor almost from the beginning. All of which makes him a pretty good recruit. As usual with these Destiny stories, there\u2019s a message from the Eleventh Doctor, and although it\u2019s chatty as that Doctor tends to be, it\u2019s not particularly insulting, and it\u2019s rather straightforward, which is probably what the Third Doctor needs to take it seriously. As a side note, the Doctor uses Venusian Aikido, and says he hasn\u2019t used it in some time, placing this before \u201cInferno.\u201d On the whole, a mostly standard story, not particularly good or bad.","title":"Vengeance of the Stones"},{"location":"bigfinish/thirddoctor/thirddoctorliz/vengeance-of-the-stones/#vengeance-of-the-stones","text":"Destiny of the Doctor #3 Released: 1 March 2013 Listened: 5/24/21 This, unfortunately, is another story without Liz present.

And the last, unfortunately, because Pertwee died before they could make another. This one is both goofier and in many ways darker than the previous. Barry Letts is still the writer, but I just don\u2019t think this is up to his usual standard; maybe he needs Terrence Dicks to help. It takes place in Sicily, because the Brig has somehow acquired an Italian great-uncle who owns a castle on an island, and wants the Brig to help him defend it against a mobster who wants to buy him out. Sarah Jane and Jeremy somehow also happen to be in Sicily at the exact same time, which is bonkers. And of course the castle is haunted, which is why the Brig calls in the Doctor. There\u2019s quite a bit of pseudo-science here, as the Doctor posits the existence of N-space as a kind of afterlife, which is leaking ghosts into the castle, and could have devastating consequences if the crack gets wider. That sets off some timey-wimey to various points in the past, to see where the ghosts are coming from. Those bits tend to be just the Doctor and Sarah, which is mostly pretty good, although Sarah spends more time in \u201cdamsel in distress\u201d mode than she normally would, which surprises me, coming from Letts.

I wouldn\u2019t normally glom onto a family, but since we were all heading to West Coast Racers right from the gate, I accompanied them and we chatted on the way.

I\u2019d ridden Apocalypse in its first year, when it was Terminator: Salvation, but I didn\u2019t ride it in November 2019, because it broke down while I was on the platform. I remember it as the first modern \u201ctwister\u201d type coaster I\u2019d ridden, and I was really impressed. I\u2019m guessing the ride on this day was a bit slow, being so early in the morning. I was surprised that the first drop is...well, that there isn\u2019t much of a first drop. It\u2019s got plenty of twister action, which is great, but not a lot of airtime to be found. Afterwards, I hung around to take some photos and video, and let my new friends get on with their day. West Coast Racers After Magic Mountain failed to open their \u201cnew for 2019\u201d coaster by late November when I visited, I was bound and determined to ride it on this trip. Fortunately, that wasn\u2019t very tricky. Although it didn\u2019t open for the day until around 11, there was no problem once it did open, and very little line. I got two rides total, one back row and one front row. I don\u2019t think back row is really necessary on this ride, because the launches provide consistent acceleration, and there\u2019s barely any airtime to speak of. The fun part of this ride, in my opinion, is the racing element, which really is great. The two helixes, especially, provide a great opportunity to see the other train and even interact with the other riders. The \u201chigh five\u201d element that\u2019s the first part of each track, and probably borrowed from Twisted Colossus, offers a nice pop of air that\u2019s better in the back, but that\u2019s the only air at any point on this coaster, so that\u2019s not a good enough reason to sit in the back. The coaster guarantees a race every time by having the train that\u2019s finished the first lap wait for the second train to be ready. I imagine that could get really drawn out, but I didn\u2019t experience that. It does pretty much kill the momentum for that first train, though. It doesn\u2019t feel like a single experience, but rather two separate rides on similar coasters. It\u2019s not particularly extreme, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s meant to be. It reminded me a lot of Copperhead Strike, in that it looks like it could be an extreme coaster, but it\u2019s not really all that intense. I think it\u2019ll appeal to families, which is most likely the intent. It was fun to ride a couple of times, but I didn\u2019t really feel the need to come back to it later. Superman: Escape from Krypton Superman was my next priority, as the only coaster left in the park I hadn\u2019t ridden. I didn\u2019t get to it in 2009, when it probably had a longer line, and in 2019 it wasn\u2019t running. I remember it making a huge splash when it opened, because it was the tallest coaster in the world, although the tower is 400 feet tall, but the cars themselves rarely make it up that high. So it was important to me to ride to say that I\u2019d done it, not because I particularly relished the ride experience. I\u2019m not a huge fan of intense launches. I\u2019ll do them, but I don\u2019t seek them out. I\u2019m also not a fan of coasters that stop and change direction, like a boomerang. However, all the other coasters I\u2019ve ridden that reverse like that, do the drop with riders facing backwards. Since 2011, Superman launches backwards and drops back down forward, and that seemed to make a difference. There was barely any line, for such a prominent coaster, and it was only running one of its two tracks. The launch was sharp, but not punishing like the Ka or Dragster launch, probably because of the longer launch track. Once the vertical part of the ride started, it seemed oddly gentle as it decelerated, and you can get a pretty good view if you look around. There\u2019s just enough time to enjoy the feeling of weightlessness, and then you\u2019re falling again. The speed on the return trip seems much more natural, but the whole ride is over pretty much before you know it. Even with no line, I didn\u2019t much feel like riding again, but it\u2019s a decent experience to have done. Not as intense as I anticipated. With Tower of Terror in Australia now closed, I can claim all the operating 400-foot coasters on my credits list, so that\u2019s nice. Scream Having accomplished my two main goals for the day, I figured I\u2019d hit the most fun coaster in the park next...but Twisted Colossus was temporarily closed. So I did what everybody does when Twisted Colossus is closed, and rode Scream. I think Scream is fine, and I cut it some slack for being a clone of Medusa, which I used to enjoy a lot (although not as much recently). Plus, it rarely has a line. So I got a back-row ride, which was pretty much what I expected. I managed to ride \u201cproperly,\u201d so that I didn\u2019t experience any head-banging. And that\u2019s about it. Twisted Colossus Twisted Colossus was restored to working order fairly quickly, so I got on for a couple of rides. They were running two trains, which greatly reduces the odds of getting a duel; I think it can happen only every other loading cycle. In any event, on this ride we did the first lap alone, and the second lap with a pretty good duel. I tried to appreciate the first lap for the coaster alone, and I think I mostly succeeded. I noticed the double-down and the outward-banked turn, which I hadn\u2019t really registered last time. But the second lap with the duel was such a better experience, it\u2019s amazing. The second time around I sat in the front, which I think is a better experience for the initial drops, but not really needed for the rest of it. We didn\u2019t quite get a duel that time, although it was close. I could probably ride Twisted Colossus all day, but I was hungry, so I decided to get some food. Goliath After getting a decent quesadilla at Food, Etc. (the most generically named food place I\u2019ve ever seen), I figured I might as well ride Goliath, because it\u2019s right there. Last time I rode this, I liked the first couple of hills, and didn\u2019t care for anything after the mid-course. Another ride did little to change that opinion. The first drop is nice, typical for a hyper. The second hill has a bit of floater to it, and then...that\u2019s it. The helix wasn\u2019t particularly punishing this time, but the whole ride was a bit boring. I can see why Magic Mountain fans want a hyper or a giga, because this only technically meets the criteria. Full Throttle I\u2019m not particularly in love with Full Throttle either, but I\u2019ve only ridden it once, and there wasn\u2019t any line, which I imagine is a rare occurrence, so I thought I should take a shot. I enjoyed it more than my ride in November, probably because I wasn\u2019t nervous about the launch at all. I knew the extreme hang-time was coming, so I could enjoy it. I was sitting in the back, so the reverse launch took me very high up the track, and I even got a little airtime on the hill. That second drop was steeper than I remembered it, and it felt like the brakes didn\u2019t kick in right away. On the whole, I enjoyed it more. X2 After the new credits, X2 was probably the ride I wanted to re-evaluate the most. My two rides on it in November were near the end of the day, and I spent pretty much the whole ride trying to figure out what was going on. Last time, I rode the last row, inside seat, on both left and right sides. This time, I really wanted to see what that face-first drop is like from the front row, so I went there. As it happened, I was paired up with another solo rider, a teenage girl, who wanted the inside seat, so I took the outside. The first thing I noticed is that the view from the lift hill is absolutely amazing, which I didn\u2019t notice at night. The face-first drop didn\u2019t seem particularly dramatic to me. There\u2019s no real feeling of free-fall, probably because of the restraints. By the time you register that you\u2019re facing down, it\u2019s over. Once again, I had a hard time following exactly what was going on, but I did notice that the flips were very janky in the outside seat. I found myself trying to ride defensively, which I couldn\u2019t, because of the changes of direction. I got a really good whack to the head right after the second raven turn that significantly dampened my enjoyment. After that, I wanted to try the inside front row from the opposite side, but the ride op sent me to the left side, and didn\u2019t acknowledge my request to swap, even though there was barely any line. So at least I was able to get the inside seat in the front car. It was noticeably less janky there, but far from smooth, and I still got whacked in the head even though I was ready for it. I thought about trying again to get the other side, but there\u2019s only so much head-whacking I can take. Viper I took a quick ride on Viper next, not because I\u2019m a huge fan of Viper, but because it\u2019s right there, it had no line, and it\u2019s the coaster most likely to be removed before I visit the park again. Plus, I have some nostalgia for the Great American Scream Machine from Great Adventure, and Viper is the last of the Arrow Mega-Loopers left standing. The restraints are still weird, and the transitions are still janky. It\u2019s kinda slow, because of its age, and there\u2019s no airtime to speak of. But the batwing element is pretty cool, and the vertical loops are smooth, so there\u2019s that. Tatsu Because I visit so many parks solo, I can pay attention to the phenomenon that is the coaster headache. It starts by setting you up with fatigue from walking around the park all day, especially a steep one like Magic Mountain. Add in some stress on your body by riding extreme coasters with little down-time, and now you\u2019re primed. Add in a good whack on the head like X2 had just given me, and you\u2019ve got a coaster headache. So I was thinking it might be time to go, and the park wouldn\u2019t be open much longer anyway, but I certainly wasn\u2019t going to leave before riding Tatsu, so I went and did that. The wait was long enough that most of my headache dissipated, but it still wasn\u2019t quite as enjoyable as Tatsu can be. I spent a lot of time trying to look straight down, instead of forward, which I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve done before. The views are pretty impressive. The pretzel loop felt a bit more violent than usual, so I decided to call it a day after that.","title":"Six Flags Magic Mountain"},{"location":"coasters/2020/sixflagsmagicmountain/#six-flags-magic-mountain","text":"Visited: March 9, 2020 Attending: Just Brian It was 10 years between my first visit to Magic Mountain and my second, but my third was just a few months after that. I had a conference in Pasadena, and I wasn\u2019t about to miss a second chance to ride West Coast Racers, so I rented a car and drove up the day after the conference. It was a Monday in March, and school was in session, so the park was pretty quiet. Almost everything was a station wait, but almost everything was also running just one train, so even station waits took a little while.

I kept to my decision not to go back to any park until I was fully vaccinated, and because of the date of my vaccination, that meant the only Power Hour I could attend was the very last one. But it was only $5 for passholders, and included free parking, so I figured it was worth the money to go. I couldn\u2019t get anybody else to go with me on a weeknight, so I went by myself. The weather was very pleasant, not too warm or humid. The evening light made for nice photography. However, the event ran from 4 to 9 pm, and it was late enough in the spring that there wouldn\u2019t be any night rides. All the coasters were running that I saw, and most of them were running multiple trains. However, most of the employees were new and in the process of being trained, so the dispatches were somewhat slow. This was also my first experience with COVID restrictions at a park, although many of them were already easing in this part of the country. I entered the park through a different entrance than usual, but there was no temperature screening, and security was a walk-through, even though I was carrying a bag. I went masked the whole time, and I\u2019d say roughly a third to half of the guests I saw did the same. There were distancing markers in the queues, but they seemed to be mostly ignored, although guests were standing slightly further apart than in the past. Most of the rides I rode didn\u2019t have long lines, so I didn\u2019t really get to judge. They were using all rows of the coasters, but they weren\u2019t mixing parties within a single row. That meant that as a single rider, I always had a row to myself, which felt a little awkward on the four-across B&M trains. Staff were also assigning rows, and since I knew I was locking out an entire row, I didn\u2019t usually ask for special treatment. Crowds were pretty light at the start of the event, before work let out, and although they increased throughout the evening, they never got to what I would call heavy. However, the attendees were concentrated at the coasters, since they were the only things open. There was some entertainment, a DJ by the fountain on the midway, but I don\u2019t think anybody was paying attention to them. Although there was supposedly food for sale, I had a very hard time finding any restaurants that were open, so I just went without eating. Bottom line, though, was that the experience felt a little different than it had in the past. Being solo wasn\u2019t a very enjoyable experience, even though I\u2019d been solo on several trips over the past three years. I did share photos on Twitter and got a good response, but it wasn\u2019t really the same. Chatting with the other enthusiasts at Jersey Devil should have made me feel more of a sense of belonging, but the age gap just felt awkward to me. And although it was probably just being out of practice, the riding experience felt more physically difficult than it has in the past. I felt a little beat up, and didn\u2019t really go for a ton of rides. I\u2019m pretty sure that I would have enjoyed myself a lot more with company, but I was ready to leave after a few hours. As a result of this experience, I decided not to try to attend the preview days for Jersey Devil, and canceled my plans to attend CoasterCon, both of which I would have been doing on my own. Nitro I chose Nitro as my first coaster to ride post-quarantine, because it\u2019s always been a favorite of mine, even if it\u2019s not the highest-rated coaster in the park. Because of the row restrictions I mentioned above, I didn\u2019t get to experience a back-row ride, but I did get three rides in quick succession, from near the back, near the front, and middle-ish. I felt a slight bit of trepidation as we climbed the lift hill, from having not been on a coaster in over a year, but that passed pretty quickly as I felt the familiar airtime sensations. Nitro was fully warmed up and running well, which made for a much better experience than my December 2019 rides. The airtime on the big hills was nice and sustained, and even the bunny-hops at the end were packing good airtime. I\u2019ve never given much thought to the helix on this ride, but I did notice this time that it packs sustained positive G\u2019s. Jersey Devil No, I didn\u2019t get to ride Jersey Devil on this trip, but it\u2019s near to Nitro, so I went over there to see how it looked. They were doing some test runs with water dummies, and put a second train on as I was watching. There were a handful of other enthusiasts there as well, and I nerded out with them for a bit. Apparently El Toro Ryan showed up just after I left, which is slightly amusing, because I went over to... El Toro I think it\u2019s fair to say that El Toro is probably the objectively best ride in the park, from an enthusiast perspective, so that was the other thing I really wanted to get on. I was pleased that there was barely any line, even during an event ostensibly for enthusiasts. Because Toro has a long train, and two-across seating, I didn\u2019t feel guilty asking for the back row, which I got. El Toro remains the monster that it\u2019s always been, and the airtime over those first three hills was sweet. The Rolling Thunder hill tried to eject me out of the train, as it\u2019s designed to do. The twister section pounded on me a little bit, which I again attributed to being out of condition. I went around again and got a second ride from row 3. Not sure if that\u2019s a \u201cmagic seat\u201d for this ride, but I did enjoy the difference in forces from the front. But there was enough pounding that I thought I\u2019d be OK with two rides in quick succession. Bizarro From Toro, I went over to Medusa (or Bizarro, whatever), mostly out of a sense of not knowing what to do next. Again, because it\u2019s a wider B&M ride, I wasn\u2019t really picky about where in the train I ended up, so I didn\u2019t get the back row. Although I\u2019ve ridden Medusa well in the past, I\u2019ve started to be really wary of head-banging on any B&M with the hard restraints, but this ride was pretty smooth. The flame-throwers on the dive loop were operating, which I hadn\u2019t seen in a while. It\u2019s not that they\u2019re particularly scary, but it\u2019s kind of fun to feel the heat bloom as you go by. I was OK through the corkscrews, so that went well. However, we did stack for quite a while on the brake run, again because of newbie operators, so I decided I didn\u2019t need to go again. Stuff I didn\u2019t ride While in line for El Toro, I looked at Kingda Ka a few times, and although it seemed to be running fairly well, I didn\u2019t feel too enthusiastic about it. It\u2019s a one-trick pony, and I\u2019ve done that trick, so I didn\u2019t feel a strong urge to go ride it. I went over to Superman: Ultimate Flight, but by that point the crowds had started to build, and even though it looked like Superman was running two trains, the poor operations that evening resulted in a line that looked to be about an hour long, which was more than I was willing to wait for that ride. I didn\u2019t even consider Green Lantern, which is questionably enjoyable at the best of times. Since I wasn\u2019t really feeling the groove, and it was starting to get late, I decided to just go home at that point.","title":"Six Flags Great Adventure"},{"location":"coasters/2021/sixflagsgreatadventure1/#six-flags-great-adventure","text":"Visited: May 27, 2021 Attending: Just Brian In May of 2021, Great Adventure had a promotion called \u201cCoaster Power Hours\u201d on Thursday nights, where only the coasters would be open, as an attempt to draw enthusiasts back to the park. I kept to my decision not to go back to any park until I was fully vaccinated, and because of the date of my vaccination, that meant the only Power Hour I could attend was the very last one. But it was only $5 for passholders, and included free parking, so I figured it was worth the money to go. I couldn\u2019t get anybody else to go with me on a weeknight, so I went by myself. The weather was very pleasant, not too warm or humid. The evening light made for nice photography. However, the event ran from 4 to 9 pm, and it was late enough in the spring that there wouldn\u2019t be any night rides. All the coasters were running that I saw, and most of them were running multiple trains. However, most of the employees were new and in the process of being trained, so the dispatches were somewhat slow. This was also my first experience with COVID restrictions at a park, although many of them were already easing in this part of the country. I entered the park through a different entrance than usual, but there was no temperature screening, and security was a walk-through, even though I was carrying a bag. I went masked the whole time, and I\u2019d say roughly a third to half of the guests I saw did the same. There were distancing markers in the queues, but they seemed to be mostly ignored, although guests were standing slightly further apart than in the past. Most of the rides I rode didn\u2019t have long lines, so I didn\u2019t really get to judge. They were using all rows of the coasters, but they weren\u2019t mixing parties within a single row. That meant that as a single rider, I always had a row to myself, which felt a little awkward on the four-across B&M trains. Staff were also assigning rows, and since I knew I was locking out an entire row, I didn\u2019t usually ask for special treatment. Crowds were pretty light at the start of the event, before work let out, and although they increased throughout the evening, they never got to what I would call heavy. However, the attendees were concentrated at the coasters, since they were the only things open. There was some entertainment, a DJ by the fountain on the midway, but I don\u2019t think anybody was paying attention to them. Although there was supposedly food for sale, I had a very hard time finding any restaurants that were open, so I just went without eating. Bottom line, though, was that the experience felt a little different than it had in the past. Being solo wasn\u2019t a very enjoyable experience, even though I\u2019d been solo on several trips over the past three years. I did share photos on Twitter and got a good response, but it wasn\u2019t really the same. Chatting with the other enthusiasts at Jersey Devil should have made me feel more of a sense of belonging, but the age gap just felt awkward to me. And although it was probably just being out of practice, the riding experience felt more physically difficult than it has in the past. I felt a little beat up, and didn\u2019t really go for a ton of rides. I\u2019m pretty sure that I would have enjoyed myself a lot more with company, but I was ready to leave after a few hours. As a result of this experience, I decided not to try to attend the preview days for Jersey Devil, and canceled my plans to attend CoasterCon, both of which I would have been doing on my own.","title":"Six Flags Great Adventure"},{"location":"coasters/2021/sixflagsgreatadventure1/#nitro","text":"I chose Nitro as my first coaster to ride post-quarantine, because it\u2019s always been a favorite of mine, even if it\u2019s not the highest-rated coaster in the park.

I felt a slight bit of trepidation as we climbed the lift hill, from having not been on a coaster in over a year, but that passed pretty quickly as I felt the familiar airtime sensations. Nitro was fully warmed up and running well, which made for a much better experience than my December 2019 rides.

But the SFNE trip could only happen while we were on vacation, and Doug wanted to go to the last SFGA \u201cPower Hour\u201d in September, which is on a Thursday, so here we are. The weather was a touch cool, as it got dark early, but on the whole a nice evening. Surprisingly, the lines were short -- everything was a station wait, or near enough. Unfortunately, El Toro wasn\u2019t running (because of the damage done earlier in the year), and neither was Kingda Ka (don\u2019t know why), but we still had a fun time. Jersey Devil This was our primary goal for the evening, the RMC single-rail that had been open since June, but I hadn\u2019t made it out there to ride it. I\u2019d been avoiding reviews so I could form my own decision, but I still managed to get the impression that it wasn\u2019t as well-liked as the other, smaller Raptor models. The lines were quite short, so we got to ride fairly quickly, opting for the back two cars. The single-rail seating is kind of strange, as your feet straddle the rail, protected by the car, but it still feels odd. Great Adventure was quite serious about having empty pockets, and I got ejected once for having my keys on me, so I popped them in a locker with everything else. The experience was \u201cfine,\u201d for the most part. It had some good speed, a couple of whippy transitions, but not Intamin-style, and the stall is impressively long. If it had been the first RMC I\u2019d ever ridden, I probably would have been quite impressed. But I\u2019ve ridden some of the best RMC conversions out there, and my expectations were higher. It was still good, to be sure, and we got a half-dozen rides, alternating front and back. I\u2019m not sure if the front was better from a perspective of forces, but being the first person on a one-seat-wide train is a very unusual experience. The sun went down while we were riding, so depending on how you look at it, we either got day and night rides, or \u201cdusk\u201d and \u201cdarker dusk\u201d rides, whichever.

One of the minor things we decided to do was visit Six Flags New England, since neither of us had ever been, and we still had Six Flags season passes. It was a reasonably nice day, the crowds weren\u2019t bad for a Sunday, but it wasn\u2019t exactly dead, either. We decided to spend only a couple of hours there, so we didn\u2019t ride a ton of things. Superman the Ride This Intamin hyper was about a third of the reason I wanted to visit this park. I\u2019ve ridden really intense Intamins like Intimidator 305 and Skyrush, and Superman at Six Flags America, but this one had so much praise heaped on it when it was new, I was anticipating a great ride. And for the most part, it was. As many people have noted before, it has an airtime-filled first half, and a twister second half, both high quality. The view of the river from the lift hill is also pretty cool. The airtime second is good, not exactly the level of Fury or even the better B&M hypers, but still good. The twister section is really first-rate, because not a lot of coasters do that. It doesn\u2019t have snappy transitions like I305 or Maverick, but it does have nice banked turns, and the tunnels produce a good head-chopper effect. It made a good first impression, and I\u2019d like to ride it again to see how it holds up, but it had a fairly long line, so we didn\u2019t. Batman the Dark Knight This is a B&M floorless that\u2019s near to Superman, and Carole and I both like that type, so we went there next. There wasn\u2019t as much line as Superman had, so that was nice. As a ride, it\u2019s...fine.

The track goes through the big vertical loop, and that\u2019s always kind of cool, but that\u2019s really about it. Riddler Revenge We didn\u2019t actually ride this. I was curious about it, because it\u2019s a Vekoma SLC with the new trains, which removes the head-banging, and I wanted to see how that went. However, they were only running one train, and the line was barely moving at all. After 20 minutes of going almost nowhere, we bailed. Goliath No, we didn\u2019t ride this, either, because it was closed, probably for good. According to most enthusiasts, we didn\u2019t really miss anything, but come on. There are only two Giant Inverted Boomerangs left in the US, and one is in Northern Idaho. So I would have ridden it, just to see what it was like.

Carole decided not to ride, and I was worried about how long the line would be, but I needn\u2019t have; there was barely any.

I\u2019ve been on compact RMCs like Twisted Timbers and Twisted Colossus, but I\u2019ve never been on one that intense.

Which was pretty exciting, because I always enjoy Fury 325, but a small number of members decided to go to Busch Gardens Williamsburg on the Friday before the official event started, and I was quite excited about that, as I\u2019d never been there before. BGW is a five-hour drive from my house with no stops, so too far for a day trip, but not far enough to be a destination. I needed an excuse, and this provided it. I left home at around 5:30 a.m., which is pretty much the earliest I can get myself out the door, took minimal stops, and made it there around 11. That\u2019s an hour after rope-drop, so most of the crew was in the park already. Fortunately, I had Discord to help me coordinate. Alpengeist Through the wonder of the Internet, I was informed that Pantheon hadn\u2019t opened yet, and although the crew was at Verbolten, that wasn\u2019t open either, so they\u2019d all moved on to Alpengeist. Fortunately, I met up with Larson and some other folks who were willing to ride it with me. It\u2019s a B&M invert, and that was pretty much all I knew about it. I had no idea until later that it\u2019s the tallest of the inverts. In what\u2019s going to become a theme for this trip, the coaster makes amazing use of the terrain, and it\u2019s kinda hard to see much of it because of the foliage, so you can\u2019t tell it\u2019s particularly tall, even when you\u2019re riding it. The theming isn\u2019t super-strong, but it\u2019s pretty good. There are sections where you\u2019re in a channel above \u201csnow covered\u201d ground, which isn\u2019t a trick that inverts often do, but feels like it might have been inherited from Big Bad Wolf. It also has a cobra roll, which is unusual on an invert, and that element ain\u2019t gentle. There\u2019s a distinct snap going in and coming out of it. I was in the back seat, so I had maximum whippiness, but a minimal view. Getting a front-row ride will be a priority next time I go back. Verbolten We\u2019d been informed at this point that Pantheon was open, but had little line, so our group headed in that direction, but we noticed that Verbolten was open with no line, so we did that quickly. Again, I knew some things about this ride, but not a ton of details. I had no idea that the indoor area was so extensive. If I had, I probably wouldn\u2019t have worn my sunglasses, but since I had them strapped to my head, I couldn\u2019t see a thing inside the building. I couldn\u2019t really hear either, so in the slow section, I couldn\u2019t tell if I was moving or not. I knew there was a drop track, but for some reason I thought it came at the end of the ride. I braced for it, but it was still pretty startling; I came right up off the seat. Then it was out into the sunshine, over the Big Bad Wolf drop, and that\u2019s pretty much it. It was fun and atmospheric, but not really what I was expecting. I thought there\u2019d be more outside. Pantheon Pantheon was the primary goal of most of the Buzzed Bars group, and I was pretty psyched for it. I needed to stash my things in a locker, so I was toward the back of our group, and in fact we got a little spread out, but I still had some enthusiasts to talk to, including Matt, a self-proclaimed Intamin fanboy who would become my companion for the rest of the day. We managed to get the back row, which was totally worth it. Again, I had some idea of what elements were involved, but not a lot of detail. The initial launch and inversion right outside the station is too intense to be a jo-jo roll, but I could still feel the direction of gravity, so that was neat. The launches on the swing section are fairly intense. Not so much as Dragster, but you can definitely feel the punch. Dropping back down the top hat was no big deal, but the speed hill between the launches was surprisingly sharp going backwards. And since we were in the back car, we went way up the spike. Didn\u2019t really feel much beyond vertical, but that was still plenty. The wave turn was nicely effective, and the stall was on-point, lasting just long enough to begin to pull you toward the ground. It had a couple of nice Intamin snaps, but nothing ridiculous. There\u2019s a little bit of meandering, but on the whole, I think it\u2019s very nicely paced. My only real complaint is that unlike every other ride in the park, it doesn\u2019t really use the terrain, and there\u2019s no theming. Maybe it\u2019ll be different once some foliage grows up around it. Definitely a highlight, and one I wouldn\u2019t mind experiencing again. Apollo\u2019s Chariot Matt agreed to accompany me on a credit-run for the rest of the park, as he\u2019d been there before. We also agreed to skip Tempesto, because Matt doesn\u2019t like the restraints on Skyrockets, and I really didn\u2019t care much about it. So we bopped over to Apollo\u2019s Chariot, which is next. I knew this was the prototype B&M hyper, so that gave me some expectations. I also knew it had a B&M pre-drop, which is why we opted for the last row again. It\u2019s only 170 feet tall, but drops down into a ravine with a creek at the bottom, for a 210-foot drop. It doesn\u2019t make huge use of the terrain, but more than most hypers I\u2019ve ridden. It\u2019s mostly just straight out-and-back, with beautiful B&M floater airtime, and it certainly delivers. The turnaround is a helix, and it\u2019s a plenty big helix. Not as forceful as Nitro\u2019s, but it goes on for a while. Then there\u2019s bunny-hops, and one last deceptively deep drop just before the brakes that you can\u2019t see coming, so that was a fun surprise. I really liked it, especially for a first experience. Loch Ness Monster Nessie was my highest priority of what was left. I haven\u2019t been kind to old Arrow loopers in this space, but Nessie is something different. It\u2019s the icon of the park, a legendary ride, and gorgeous with the interlocking loops. We snagged the back row again, with very little wait. The initial drop down over the river was faster and more intense than I\u2019d expected, which was cool. The first loop pretty much felt like a standard Arrow loop (because it is). I didn\u2019t know about the tunnel, though. It\u2019s a helix, with at least two full circles in it, and it\u2019s tight. There are points on the second round where you can see the track above your head, and it feels like it\u2019s close enough to touch. There\u2019s a second lift, although not very large, and the second loop feels kind of like an afterthought, but hey, it\u2019s cool to do the interlocking loop thing. Having two trains on the loops at once would be even cooler, but I\u2019m sure they don\u2019t do that anymore. It had good speed and pacing, even on a cold day. I\u2019d rank this above the other remaining Arrows, even Viper, for originality and thrills. It\u2019s clear this is a well-maintained coaster, and I hope it stays that way. Griffon Next up, we went over to Griffon. My only prior experience with dive coasters is Valravn, which didn\u2019t really wow me, so I didn\u2019t know what to expect here. I knew there were some differences in layout, and that Griffon has the older shoulder bars instead of the vest restraints, but I didn\u2019t know how much difference that would make. Matt suggested the front row, and we ended up right in the center, which was neat. The hang seemed less scary than my Valravn ride, and I\u2019m not sure we got to a full 90 degrees during the hang. The sign painted on the ground made me laugh. The drop was good, but I\u2019m not certain what difference the restraints made without trying again. Matt felt a definite difference, though. I was pleased that Griffon goes under a bridge, rather than just pulling out of the drop, although it could be better. What surprised me was how much speed it maintained through the rest of the ride. I don\u2019t really expect much airtime from a dive coaster, but it was there. I was also surprised that the splashdown didn\u2019t cut the speed much at all. I was expecting a little jerk from the braking action of the water, but there was nothing. I liked this one far better than I had expected to. InvadR That left only the oddly-spelled InvadR to wrap up. This is a thrill coaster, not an extreme one, but it\u2019s far from tame. It\u2019s a GCI, and relatively new, so it\u2019s pretty smooth. It uses the terrain well, and it\u2019s got nice laterals in a twister layout, with all the GCI signatures. It even has an unusually sharp pop of air very close to the end. It\u2019s definitely something you could take a kid on, but it would be an intense experience for them. Once again, I liked it more than I thought I would. That seems to be the other theme for the day, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because I had company, where I\u2019m normally alone. Or maybe it was specifically enthusiast company; I\u2019m not sure. After completing the cred-hunt, we stopped at the Festhaus, where I had a turkey sandwich on a pretzel roll that was actually quite good. It was getting close to 3:00 at that point, and Matt wanted to get started driving so he could make it to Charlotte. I agreed that was a good idea, but I wanted to see if I could get in on the wolf encounter experience. Unfortunately, I got a little lost, so I was slightly too late for the encounter, but I was able to see the wolves in their enclosure for a while. That\u2019ll give me another reason to go back. I eventually got back to my car around 3:45, which was earlier than I\u2019d originally planned, but a much better choice, because I didn\u2019t get to Charlotte until around 10.","title":"Busch Gardens Williamsburg"},{"location":"coasters/2022/buschgardenswilliamsburg/#busch-gardens-williamsburg","text":"Visited: April 8, 2022 Attending: Brian and a subset of Buzzed Bars Although I missed an unofficial Orlando trip in February, Buzzed Bars\u2019 first official Stumble for the year was Carowinds in April.

Nevertheless, after a positive experience on Friday, I was looking forward to Saturday. I met up with Matt outside the gate, introduced myself to Alison and Steven, met Gabby, and a handful of other people. We were all inside by rope drop, because we were a coaster crew on a mission: Fury 325. Hurler \u2026and unfortunately it wasn\u2019t open right at 10:00. It looked like it was going to be a little while at least, so we decided to ride Hurler, as the next nearest coaster. I\u2019d ridden Hurler in 2017, but remembered nearly nothing about it. Now that I\u2019ve ridden Twisted Timbers more than a few times (which was identical to Hurler before it was RMC\u2019d), it\u2019s an entirely different experience. The queue line and the station felt identical, although we weren\u2019t waiting long. In fact, it was very clear to the ride ops that this was a coaster club, because there\u2019s no other way a group of 100 people would show up to ride Hurler at 10:00. We got seats pretty much in the middle, because we didn\u2019t really care where we ended up. The layout was almost exactly the same as Twisted Timbers, with all the fun parts taken out. I hoped for some airtime on the camelback hills that come after the first turn, but alas, there was none to be found. It\u2019s really not fair to compare Hurler to an RMC, but when it basically provides a \u201cbefore and after\u201d like that, what else can you do? Carolina Cyclone Carolina Cyclone is an old Arrow looper, which many parks seem to still have one of. In 2017, I thought this was amazingly slow and janky, to the point where I was just laughing at it. This time, we went for the back row, and I thought there was a little bit of a bite to it. The transitions are still janky, and the corkscrew isn\u2019t a lot of fun, but the two vertical loops have some intensity. It\u2019s certainly not my favorite ride in the park, but I\u2019m glad I rode it today. Fury 325 At this point, Fury opened up, and the Buzzed Bars filled several trains. I snagged a back-row ride along with Matt and another guy who\u2019d never ridden it before. The ride was excellent, as back-row rides on Fury often are, but it was still fairly cold out, and these were among the first trains of the day. It was still a better experience than most coasters, but I did think it was running a little slow. Matt and the other guy were impressed, but not blown away, which makes sense. We decided to go for the other credits and come back to Fury again later. Copperhead Strike Because Matt had two days at the park, he decided to hit his highest priorities today rather than picking up \u201cjunk\u201d credits like the wild mouse and mine train. (And Vortex was closed, which I was not at all sad about.) The club headed en masse to Copperhead next, so we followed. This time, there actually was a queue, so we ended up waiting a while in line, which was perfectly fine, because it gave us a chance to talk about coasters. Once again, we took over several trains in a row, which was the intent. Once again, I found myself enjoying the launches here more than the more violent launches of a Kingda Ka or Dragster. The absurd amount of hang-time in the loops continues to impress me, and every time I rode this today, I couldn\u2019t keep my hands up through the jo-jo roll. The seats remain very comfortable, and the ops weren\u2019t inclined to staple, but the nature of the restraints means they tighten as the ride goes on. Afterburn After that, the group split up somewhat, and my small subgroup headed over to Afterburn. I previously had two rides on this from the back row, and I wanted to go for the front, as I enjoy inverts from the front, but for various reasons, hadn\u2019t done this one yet. As I expected, one can appreciate the layout more from the front, and being able to see what happens adds to the enjoyment \u2013 with the exception of the sharp zero-g roll right after the station flyover; you just can\u2019t see that one coming. As usual, being in the front provided some odd sensations, especially in the inversions, but we knew that was coming. My opinion of Afterburn has improved since I first rode it, but without riding Banshee or Montu, I don\u2019t really know how to rank the inverts. After that, we\u2019d accomplished most of the major coasters, and it was early afternoon, so we went over to Harmony Hall to get some food. I had a grilled cheese with picked chicken inside, which wasn\u2019t as interesting as I expected. Not enough cheese. Still, I like Harmony Hall\u2019s atmosphere. More Copperhead After lunch, the group planned to meet up again for some unofficial ride takeovers. Copperhead was first, and it was still pretty much the same as before. I can\u2019t remember where I sat on this one, but I think it was toward the back. Plants vs. Zombies After that, the whole group went to do the Plants vs. Zombies theater\u2026thing. It\u2019s kind of like a shooting dark ride, without the ride. It takes place in a theater, and we filled the whole thing by ourselves, which was pretty much the point. I\u2019d never do something like this on my own\u2026in fact, I had no idea it was there before that day. I was also surprised at how long it\u2019s been since I even thought about Plants vs. Zombies; that theme is really played out. I have absolutely no idea how I personally did in the game, but my side won, so there\u2019s that. Somewhere around this point, it started getting very cold and rainy. It was later in the afternoon, and I was getting kinda tired. And I wasn\u2019t alone in that; lots of club members felt the same way. The original intent was to have a tailgate in the parking lot, but it was really too cold. Lots of folks were staying at the hotel on the property, so we went back over there for a rest and some drinks. Unfortunately, we got chased out of the bar onto the patio, which was lacking in heat sources. After I\u2019d been there for a while, it became clear the weather wasn\u2019t going to clear, so I thought I\u2019d go back into the park, eat something hot, and then bail. I met up with Matt and a few others at Chickie\u2019s & Pete\u2019s for a cheese steak and crab fries, after which I was feeling much better, and the skies had actually cleared a bit, so I decided to stay. Intimidator After the tailgate, there was supposed to be more group riding of Fury, but folks were really slow getting back from the hotel, so people were just riding it whenever they felt like it. In chatting with Matt, it came up that I hadn\u2019t ridden Intimidator that day (the rest of the club rode it mid-afternoon), and that it was supposedly running well. I had a couple of rides on it before, and it never impressed me; it always seemed like the trims were running too heavy. However, Matt and I decided to take a chance on a night ride. Fortunately, the rain had cleared out the park, so it was a walk-on, and we grabbed the back row pretty easily, although the center seats rather than the wings. I have to say that was a substantial improvement over my previous rides, as the speed was working properly, and I was able to get the airtime I expect from a hyper. As many others have said, in any other park, that would probably be my favorite ride. Unfortunately, that\u2019s not the way it works. Fury 325 again After Intimidator, we headed back to Fury and found that the club had shown up, although the riding was pretty disorganized. So we went again, from the back row. While it was getting colder, there was less wind, and the wheels had warmed up nicely, so it was an awfully good night ride. I wish I\u2019d brought my gloves, but what can you do. The folks who\u2019d been skeptical before were convinced now, which was gratifying. The club stayed to do more, but it was after 9 at this point, and I had a very long drive on Sunday, so I decided to call it a night. Overall, I\u2019m very happy to have taken this trip, and to have joined the club. The members are mostly younger than me, but not a ton, and it wasn\u2019t as awkward as I\u2019d feared. In fact, they were all quite friendly and welcoming, and they mostly had social skills. After a couple of years of going solo, I really enjoyed riding with other enthusiasts again.","title":"Carowinds"},{"location":"coasters/2022/carowinds/#carowinds","text":"Visited: April 9, 2022 Attending: Brian and a whole bunch of Buzzed Bars The official Stumble 325 event was Saturday and Sunday at Carowinds, but I knew that I\u2019d only be able to attend on Saturday, needing Sunday to drive back. Nevertheless, after a positive experience on Friday, I was looking forward to Saturday.

It looked like it was going to be a little while at least, so we decided to ride Hurler, as the next nearest coaster. I\u2019d ridden Hurler in 2017, but remembered nearly nothing about it. Now that I\u2019ve ridden Twisted Timbers more than a few times (which was identical to Hurler before it was RMC\u2019d), it\u2019s an entirely different experience. The queue line and the station felt identical, although we weren\u2019t waiting long. In fact, it was very clear to the ride ops that this was a coaster club, because there\u2019s no other way a group of 100 people would show up to ride Hurler at 10:00. We got seats pretty much in the middle, because we didn\u2019t really care where we ended up. The layout was almost exactly the same as Twisted Timbers, with all the fun parts taken out. I hoped for some airtime on the camelback hills that come after the first turn, but alas, there was none to be found. It\u2019s really not fair to compare Hurler to an RMC, but when it basically provides a \u201cbefore and after\u201d like that, what else can you do?","title":"Hurler"},{"location":"coasters/2022/carowinds/#carolina-cyclone","text":"Carolina Cyclone is an old Arrow looper, which many parks seem to still have one of.

The transitions are still janky, and the corkscrew isn\u2019t a lot of fun, but the two vertical loops have some intensity.

The ride was excellent, as back-row rides on Fury often are, but it was still fairly cold out, and these were among the first trains of the day. It was still a better experience than most coasters, but I did think it was running a little slow. Matt and the other guy were impressed, but not blown away, which makes sense.

(And Vortex was closed, which I was not at all sad about.) The club headed en masse to Copperhead next, so we followed. This time, there actually was a queue, so we ended up waiting a while in line, which was perfectly fine, because it gave us a chance to talk about coasters. Once again, we took over several trains in a row, which was the intent. Once again, I found myself enjoying the launches here more than the more violent launches of a Kingda Ka or Dragster. The absurd amount of hang-time in the loops continues to impress me, and every time I rode this today, I couldn\u2019t keep my hands up through the jo-jo roll. The seats remain very comfortable, and the ops weren\u2019t inclined to staple, but the nature of the restraints means they tighten as the ride goes on.","title":"Copperhead Strike"},{"location":"coasters/2022/carowinds/#afterburn","text":"After that, the group split up somewhat, and my small subgroup headed over to Afterburn. I previously had two rides on this from the back row, and I wanted to go for the front, as I enjoy inverts from the front, but for various reasons, hadn\u2019t done this one yet. As I expected, one can appreciate the layout more from the front, and being able to see what happens adds to the enjoyment \u2013 with the exception of the sharp zero-g roll right after the station flyover; you just can\u2019t see that one coming. As usual, being in the front provided some odd sensations, especially in the inversions, but we knew that was coming. My opinion of Afterburn has improved since I first rode it, but without riding Banshee or Montu, I don\u2019t really know how to rank the inverts. After that, we\u2019d accomplished most of the major coasters, and it was early afternoon, so we went over to Harmony Hall to get some food.

I was also surprised at how long it\u2019s been since I even thought about Plants vs. Zombies; that theme is really played out. I have absolutely no idea how I personally did in the game, but my side won, so there\u2019s that. Somewhere around this point, it started getting very cold and rainy. It was later in the afternoon, and I was getting kinda tired. And I wasn\u2019t alone in that; lots of club members felt the same way. The original intent was to have a tailgate in the parking lot, but it was really too cold. Lots of folks were staying at the hotel on the property, so we went back over there for a rest and some drinks. Unfortunately, we got chased out of the bar onto the patio, which was lacking in heat sources. After I\u2019d been there for a while, it became clear the weather wasn\u2019t going to clear, so I thought I\u2019d go back into the park, eat something hot, and then bail.

We left Kennywood around 2:00, so we got to Cedar Point around dinnertime, with plenty of daylight left to spare. As Doug had bought himself a Platinum Pass, we didn\u2019t have to worry about paying for two consecutive days. So we were able to start at the Rockin\u2019 Roller Coast rather earlier than planned. Gatekeeper Steel Vengeance would have been the optimum first coaster, but the Cedar Point app said it was down. However, the app also said that Gatekeeper was a 15-minute wait, so yay for weekdays, I guess. I convinced Doug to do a front-row ride, which he normally doesn\u2019t prefer, and we went left side, so we could roll over the top on the first drop. Which was really rather cool. I\u2019ve been lukewarm on Gatekeeper in the past, but the view from the front is rather impressive. And it had some air and some other forces that weren\u2019t too bad. I\u2019ve decided I prefer the vest restraint to the hard B&M restraints, even though they are kinda snug, but I was still able to get some room. After Gatekeeper, we went over to Raptor, since it also had a short line. Unfortunately, it closed when we were nearly at the platform; high winds were cited as the reason. We stuck it out for a while, but then decided to leave it for tomorrow. Unfortunately, that took up a chunk of our time. Iron Dragon At this point, it was pretty clear that any plan we\u2019d had just wasn\u2019t going to happen. So we were just kind of heading generally toward the back of the park, to see what there is to see. Iron Dragon isn\u2019t a high priority for me; I\u2019d only ridden it once before. But it was open, and didn\u2019t have much line, so we decided to snag that while we were nearby. Last time, the line was absurdly long because the optional VR headsets added a huge delay to the loading process. Fortunately, the VR fad is gone now, so we didn\u2019t have to wait too long. I much preferred this ride to my last one in the dark. Iron Dragon doesn\u2019t have huge forces, just kind of pleasant swinging, so being able to see what you\u2019re doing instead of pitch darkness works quite nicely. Doug wasn\u2019t real thrilled about the cramped seats, but he thought it was all right. Rougarou Rougarou is right next to Iron Dragon, and it was running, for some reason. I don\u2019t know why Rougarou can run in high winds while Raptor can\u2019t, but I\u2019m not in charge of operations. With most of the big thrill rides not running, the line was longer than expected, but we didn\u2019t have anything better to do. They were running three trains, which is the first time I\u2019ve seen that, but the operations were still a bit pokey. We got the last row, and there\u2019s not much to say about this I haven\u2019t said before. It feels a bit strange, because it used to be a stand-up, but there\u2019s nothing actively wrong with it. It\u2019s mostly just fine. I\u2019ll note that with three trains, when you stack at the brakes, the last couple of rows are still at an angle, so that was kind of an odd sensation. Millennium Force By the time we got off of Rougarou, Millennium Force was back running again. Unfortunately, it had something of a line, but we decided to just deal with it. I\u2019ve ridden Millie before, but it was Doug\u2019s first time, which also made it his first giga. He\u2019s ridden Kingda Ka before, but a launch isn\u2019t the same as a 300-foot lift hill. Having the ride right at sunset made for a fairly cool experience on the lift hill, but I do like being able to see where I\u2019m going. As I\u2019ve noted before, Millie isn\u2019t my favorite giga, but I can\u2019t fault it, given when it was made. It\u2019s designed to provide speed and more speed, and pretty much nothing else. I did notice that when sitting in the back, the length of the train provides an odd feeling of acceleration during the turnarounds out on the island. Steel Vengeance The sun was starting to go down, and the app said Steel Vengeance was running, so we decided that was the best thing to do next. The line was about 30 minutes, which was the best we were likely to get, so we hopped in. I hadn\u2019t experienced the new mini-locker system on this ride yet, but it wasn\u2019t too terrible, although it did add a bit of a delay. We managed to snag the back row, much to my surprise, and it was everything I remembered from a back-of-the-train night ride. In fact, it may have even been a little more than I remembered. A couple of times, coming out of an inversion, I didn\u2019t know which way was up for a second. (In fairness, I skipped dinner, so I was possibly lightheaded.) As for Doug, I think he had his life changed. He was really impressed with the speed, but especially the way the zero-g rolls worked. Admittedly, they are wonderfully positioned within the structure. Although the outer-banked turn is still my favorite, I don\u2019t think he liked that as much as I do. However, we turned right around and got back in line, as it was getting close to closing, and the line wasn\u2019t very long anymore. We went back-row again, and swapped seats this time. I think the outer bank isn\u2019t as intense from the left side of the train, as you\u2019re on the \u201clower\u201d side of the bank, but in many other ways, being on the \u201coutside\u201d of the circuit is impressive, especially at night. As a bonus, we got to see Creech from Buzzed Bars, as he was working as a safety checker that night.

We snagged a much better parking spot than the previous day and headed on in, thanks to our passes. We had already decided to get ourselves FastLane Plus, which I\u2019d never done before at CP, in order to make sure we were able to hit all the credits in one day. But since we\u2019d already tagged some of the highlights the previous day, it took some of the pressure off for today. In the past when I\u2019d done early entry, we were allowed to enter the park, but stopped on the midway until 9. Today that wasn\u2019t the case, and although we we entered before 9, we could go wherever we liked. Steel Vengeance Although Steel Vengeance had been our last ride of the night the previous day, we figured it was still best to start there, FastLane or no FastLane. So we headed directly to the back of the park, where we discovered that Steel Vengeance wasn\u2019t open yet, and wouldn\u2019t start running until 10. However, Doug really wanted to do it first, so we waited as the park came to life around us. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ve done Steel Vengeance on a bright, clear day before; I remember my previous rides being overcast. I suggested a front-row ride for variety and for the views. It was slightly less intense and seemed a bit slower, probably because it was an early train more than the front seats. Still, I enjoyed the first drop and the inversions quite a bit from the front. Since it was still early, we circled back around and got a back-row ride. Still not as intense as a night ride, but only barely noticeable. Although we could have ridden Steel Vengeance all day (maybe), we had other credits to get. Maverick Maverick was the next stop because of its proximity and popularity. This was one ride where the FastLane came in particularly handy, as I could see about an hour\u2019s worth of people in the switchbacks, but the FastLane let us go right to the station. I think Doug was skeptical about this one because of its short height, so I deliberately didn\u2019t tell him about the second launch from the tunnel, and I was pleased by his reaction. Unfortunately, my favorite thing about Maverick is the snappy transitions, and it turns out Doug doesn\u2019t really like those. I thought that might be because he\u2019s taller, and therefore more subject to the whippiness, but it\u2019s also possible that it\u2019s just personal preference. Regardless, he acknowledged that Maverick is an excellent example of its breed, but he just doesn\u2019t happen to like the main feature of that breed. Magnum XL-200 Having gotten two major attractions out of the way, we decided it was time to hit some of the less popular rides as we made our way back down the peninsula. Unfortunately, the Mine Train and Gemini were closed (they often don\u2019t open with the park, I\u2019m told), so the first thing we met was Magnum. My experiences of Magnum have been mixed in the past, but I\u2019d heard there was a \u201cmagic seat\u201d that changed everything. Unfortunately, some quick research revealed confusion about where the magic seat actually IS. There seemed to be general agreement that not sitting over a wheel provided a smoother ride, so we went with the last car, center row. I found the experience to be more or less what I expected, so I was able to anticipate and enjoy it, especially the ejector bunny-hills that have no right to exist. Doug found the whole thing quite unpleasant, and was very vocal about the lack of proper profiling. Needless to say, he will not be joining the group who thinks that Magnum is the best ride in the park. Corkscrew Corkscrew was the next ride down the midway, and we got in line while acknowledging that we were going from one old Arrow to another. The trains have a remarkable lack of legroom, awkward positioning, and strange over-the-shoulder restraints that I can remember from when they were new. We had low expectations, and they were met. We pretty much checked it off the list and moved on. Valravn We were approaching the front of the park now, and stopped at Valravn. Although I\u2019m a fan of B&M, dive coasters are among my least favorite of their designs (just above stand-ups). Worse, it was crowded, as Valravn almost always is, and even in the FastLane queue, we spent quite a while cooking in the sun before we got to the platform. We chose to just take our assigned seats this time, so we were in the back row, a bit off-center. I don\u2019t find the \u201changing\u201d portion of dive coasters to be all that scary, and being in the back makes it even less so. There\u2019s a bit of whip to be found on the initial drop from the back row, so that made it different than just a straight freefall sensation. There was a little bit of airtime on the hill, and the ride seemed to be running well. It was definitely better than my previous time on Valravn, but I still prefer Griffon on the whole. Doug thought at this point that he preferred the vest restraints to the chunky OTSRs, but he still thought Gatekeeper was a better ride overall. After Valravn, we headed back toward Raptor, but even the FastLane queue was full. It seemed like it might have gone down again, so we decided to just have lunch instead. I admit this was my idea, because I know Chickie\u2019s & Pete\u2019s is right there, and I wanted a cheesesteak. It was still early enough that the restaurant wasn\u2019t crowded, and although the service was slow, we didn\u2019t mind. Unfortunately, Doug got a call from home indicating that there were various unexpected issues going on. Not to the point that he needed to cancel the trip, but it was something of a distraction thereafter. Blue Streak Raptor still seemed to be having issues once we were done with lunch, so we headed for Blue Streak, as it was right there. Even under conditions that probably should have drawn a crowd, the queue was nearly empty. We got assigned to the last car, against my recommendation. Turns out I was still right; the last car is absurdly rough. Doug agreed there was no point in riding that again, ever. Raptor After a couple of near misses, Raptor was finally running again. We went with the back row, because that\u2019s what Doug likes, and I let him have the outside seat, for the view. As a result, I didn\u2019t get to see very much. The cobra roll had some nice snap, although maybe not as sharp as Alpengeist\u2019s. The double helix had strong positives, which is kinda strange on an invert. It\u2019s pretty much what I expect from Raptor, which isn\u2019t my favorite invert. It\u2019s kind of middle of the pack. Gemini Having reached the front of the park again, we turned around to catch the rides we\u2019d missed, starting with Gemini. There was barely any line, and we jumped right on. Knowing what to expect this time, I was able to enjoy the racing factor, and the fact that the other train is within arm\u2019s reach at some points. (Nobody wanted to high-five me, though.) The restraints are noticeably less than everything else we\u2019d ridden that day, to the point where I may have grabbed the bar a couple of times. Gemini may be old, but it\u2019s still got a nice punch, and I\u2019d hate to see it taken down. Cedar Creek Mine Ride Now we were really just riding for the creds, but a cred is a cred, so we got in line for this one. Ops on mine rides often take a while, given the number of small children involved, so the line didn\u2019t move particularly fast. Cedar Creek is long for a mine train, with some rather janky helixes, and no real drops to speak of. There\u2019s not really a ton to say about it; it\u2019s an Arrow mine train. By this point, it was the middle of the afternoon, and getting pretty hot. So we took a break to get drinks, sit down, and evaluate our options. We\u2019d gotten some night rides the day before, so instead of sticking around for more, we decided to leave earlier and head to Kings Island, but we did want to get some more stops on the way. Millennium Force (again) Doug wanted another crack at Millennium Force, and with our Fast Lanes, it wasn\u2019t much of a problem (although Mille\u2019s Fast Lane joins the regular queue considerably earlier than you might expect). We went back-row again, but swapped sides this time. The experience was mostly the same from my point of view. The first drop is fantastic, and it\u2019s got a lot of great speed, but that\u2019s not really what I\u2019m looking for in a giga. Gatekeeper (again) We checked Gatekeeper again on the way out, and since it had an unusually short line, we decided to give it another try from the right side of the train, although still in the front row. It remains quite a lot of fun, and may have risen in my rankings a bit, but I think the front row is a must.","title":"Cedar Point"},{"location":"coasters/2022/cedarpoint2/#cedar-point","text":"Visited: July 29, 2022 Attending: Brian and Doug Friday morning, we got up bright and early, which was mostly unnecessary because we were only a mile away from the park, and it doesn\u2019t open all that early. We snagged a much better parking spot than the previous day and headed on in, thanks to our passes. We had already decided to get ourselves FastLane Plus, which I\u2019d never done before at CP, in order to make sure we were able to hit all the credits in one day. But since we\u2019d already tagged some of the highlights the previous day, it took some of the pressure off for today. In the past when I\u2019d done early entry, we were allowed to enter the park, but stopped on the midway until 9. Today that wasn\u2019t the case, and although we we entered before 9, we could go wherever we liked.","title":"Cedar Point"},{"location":"coasters/2022/cedarpoint2/#steel-vengeance","text":"Although Steel Vengeance had been our last ride of the night the previous day, we figured it was still best to start there, FastLane or no FastLane. So we headed directly to the back of the park, where we discovered that Steel Vengeance wasn\u2019t open yet, and wouldn\u2019t start running until 10. However, Doug really wanted to do it first, so we waited as the park came to life around us. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ve done Steel Vengeance on a bright, clear day before; I remember my previous rides being overcast. I suggested a front-row ride for variety and for the views. It was slightly less intense and seemed a bit slower, probably because it was an early train more than the front seats. Still, I enjoyed the first drop and the inversions quite a bit from the front. Since it was still early, we circled back around and got a back-row ride. Still not as intense as a night ride, but only barely noticeable. Although we could have ridden Steel Vengeance all day (maybe), we had other credits to get.","title":"Steel Vengeance"},{"location":"coasters/2022/cedarpoint2/#maverick","text":"Maverick was the next stop because of its proximity and popularity. This was one ride where the FastLane came in particularly handy, as I could see about an hour\u2019s worth of people in the switchbacks, but the FastLane let us go right to the station. I think Doug was skeptical about this one because of its short height, so I deliberately didn\u2019t tell him about the second launch from the tunnel, and I was pleased by his reaction. Unfortunately, my favorite thing about Maverick is the snappy transitions, and it turns out Doug doesn\u2019t really like those. I thought that might be because he\u2019s taller, and therefore more subject to the whippiness, but it\u2019s also possible that it\u2019s just personal preference. Regardless, he acknowledged that Maverick is an excellent example of its breed, but he just doesn\u2019t happen to like the main feature of that breed.","title":"Maverick"},{"location":"coasters/2022/cedarpoint2/#magnum-xl-200","text":"Having gotten two major attractions out of the way, we decided it was time to hit some of the less popular rides as we made our way back down the peninsula. Unfortunately, the Mine Train and Gemini were closed (they often don\u2019t open with the park, I\u2019m told), so the first thing we met was Magnum. My experiences of Magnum have been mixed in the past, but I\u2019d heard there was a \u201cmagic seat\u201d that changed everything. Unfortunately, some quick research revealed confusion about where the magic seat actually IS. There seemed to be general agreement that not sitting over a wheel provided a smoother ride, so we went with the last car, center row. I found the experience to be more or less what I expected, so I was able to anticipate and enjoy it, especially the ejector bunny-hills that have no right to exist. Doug found the whole thing quite unpleasant, and was very vocal about the lack of proper profiling. Needless to say, he will not be joining the group who thinks that Magnum is the best ride in the park.","title":"Magnum XL-200"},{"location":"coasters/2022/cedarpoint2/#corkscrew","text":"Corkscrew was the next ride down the midway, and we got in line while acknowledging that we were going from one old Arrow to another. The trains have a remarkable lack of legroom, awkward positioning, and strange over-the-shoulder restraints that I can remember from when they were new. We had low expectations, and they were met. We pretty much checked it off the list and moved on.","title":"Corkscrew"},{"location":"coasters/2022/cedarpoint2/#valravn","text":"We were approaching the front of the park now, and stopped at Valravn. Although I\u2019m a fan of B&M, dive coasters are among my least favorite of their designs (just above stand-ups). Worse, it was crowded, as Valravn almost always is, and even in the FastLane queue, we spent quite a while cooking in the sun before we got to the platform. We chose to just take our assigned seats this time, so we were in the back row, a bit off-center. I don\u2019t find the \u201changing\u201d portion of dive coasters to be all that scary, and being in the back makes it even less so. There\u2019s a bit of whip to be found on the initial drop from the back row, so that made it different than just a straight freefall sensation. There was a little bit of airtime on the hill, and the ride seemed to be running well. It was definitely better than my previous time on Valravn, but I still prefer Griffon on the whole. Doug thought at this point that he preferred the vest restraints to the chunky OTSRs, but he still thought Gatekeeper was a better ride overall. After Valravn, we headed back toward Raptor, but even the FastLane queue was full. It seemed like it might have gone down again, so we decided to just have lunch instead. I admit this was my idea, because I know Chickie\u2019s & Pete\u2019s is right there, and I wanted a cheesesteak. It was still early enough that the restaurant wasn\u2019t crowded, and although the service was slow, we didn\u2019t mind. Unfortunately, Doug got a call from home indicating that there were various unexpected issues going on. Not to the point that he needed to cancel the trip, but it was something of a distraction thereafter.","title":"Valravn"},{"location":"coasters/2022/cedarpoint2/#blue-streak","text":"Raptor still seemed to be having issues once we were done with lunch, so we headed for Blue Streak, as it was right there.

One of these was Bryant, a.k.a. Coaster365, whom I\u2019d wanted to meet for a while, but we kept missing each other. When he announced on Discord that he was going to come down from New England and visit Hershey that weekend, I decided to seize the moment. Several other folks were there, so we had a nice group of either 7 or 8, depending on the time of day. According to this journal, it\u2019s been years since I\u2019ve been to Hershey, certainly before I got serious about being an enthusiast, so it was interesting to come back with more experienced eyes. Storm Runner Because I was the only one with a (newly acquired) season pass, we didn\u2019t get early admission. Several of us needed to ride Candymonium, but since it\u2019s right at the front of the park now, us experienced coaster folk knew that\u2019d be a bad idea, so we headed to the back of the park for Storm Runner. Which turned out to be a great idea, because we basically got a walk-on. Well, sort of a walk-on, because I got separated from the group and had to take the next train, but whatever. It was cool to ride Storm Runner after having ridden Xcelerator, as well as Ka and Dragster, because I have a basis for comparison now. Storm Runner\u2019s launch isn\u2019t the most intense, but that\u2019s cool, because I don\u2019t really like the top-tier intense ones. The seats are just as upright as I remember. I said years ago that it\u2019s like riding in a kitchen chair strapped to a sled, and that\u2019s still true. As a result, the straight-down drop feels even more dangerous. But amazingly, Storm Runner actually does something with its speed. It\u2019s only a couple of elements, although they\u2019re deeply strange elements, but it\u2019s still more than any of the other launchers do. Jolly Rancher Remix When I last rode this boomerang, it was called Sidewinder, and it was unexpectedly good, for a boomerang. Now, it\u2019s been completely refurbished: new paint, new station, added a tunnel with fog effects. It\u2019s themed to Jolly Ranchers now, and I don\u2019t care about Jolly Ranchers, but HersheyPark seems to be leaning in to the candy theming for its rides now. The restraints are now the soft vests instead of the old head-bangers, which is a huge improvement. They\u2019ve also got a soundtrack synced to the motion of the train, with speakers all the way up both spikes so you can hear it clearly the whole time. The tunnel I could take or leave. The fog is supposed to smell like Jolly Ranchers, but honestly, it just smelled like dry ice to me. We were able to hop right on, and having a station wait always enhances an experience. Ultimately, it\u2019s just a boomerang, but the loop is forceful, and the cobra roll\u2019s transitions have some jank, so it\u2019s not something I\u2019ll go out of my way to ride, but it\u2019s probably my favorite boomerang now. We expressed a desire to ride the new flat ride, Mix\u2019d, a Zamperla NebulaZ, but the line was just a touch long for our taste. It\u2019s really fun to look at, and I do look forward to riding it sometime. Wildcat There\u2019s universal acknowledgment that Wildcat is a pretty terrible coaster. It\u2019s the first CGI, and back when twister layouts were unheard of, it looked pretty cool. But that was a long time ago. So why ride it now? Because it\u2019s officially closing at the end of July, and the rumors are heavy that it\u2019ll get the RMC treatment. As of this writing, we don\u2019t know for sure, but we saw paint marks in \u201cRMC blue\u201d on some of the footers, so we\u2019ll see. Naturally, we all had to take it for a final spin. And yeah, it\u2019s terrible. I mean, the layout is pretty cool, but wow, it\u2019s rough. There\u2019s one spot right shortly before the brakes where the track just kind of lurches to the right, for absolutely no reason that I could see. So we did what was necessary, paid our respects, and now we\u2019re done. Lightning Racer We debated riding Laff Trak, but the line was probably too long. I still need that credit, but I\u2019ll have to get it another time. So we went over to a much better CGI, which was also a walk-on, because back of park. It\u2019s a racing coaster, so someone suggested that we split the party by gender and see who won. That turned out to be a lot of fun. I\u2019ve known since Twisted Colossus that dueling coasters are fun when they duel, but having friends on the other train makes it even still more fun. Lightning Racer is smoother than Wildcat, but with just enough rumble to make it fun. The layout is twisted enough that you\u2019re never really sure where you\u2019re going next, and it\u2019s nicely long too. As it happens, the guys won (riding Thunder), but it was also pointed out (fairly) that there were four of us to three of them, and we weigh more on average. But whatever. Skyrush We knew we had to brave the front of the park at some point, and we had lunch reservations, so we went back to Skyrush. We\u2019d all ridden this before, but for some of us it had been a while. We had to wait about 30 minutes, probably the longest line we had all day, but that was fine. We opted for back seats, and I went for the left wing, as I often do. The last time I rode this, I wasn\u2019t in the habit of putting my hands up for a ride, a fact that I totally forgot until about halfway down the first drop, when I felt like I was sliding uncomfortably. That wasn\u2019t very likely, given the infamous restraints, but I had to grab the handles several times, to my embarrassment. After having ridden a bunch of intense coasters, Skyrush remains up there with the top of the field. I know it\u2019s 200 ft, but it doesn\u2019t really seem like it, and yet the amount of speed it has is absurd. It only has a couple of sharp snaps like i305 or Maverick, but that\u2019s for the best because I don\u2019t think the wings could take it. I will say that the restraints didn\u2019t bother me much, but it was something of a relief when they released on the brake run. We tried to get in a ride on Candymonium before lunch, but it was 2:00 at this point, and the line said it was 45 minutes, so we didn\u2019t think that would work. Lunch Matt had made reservations at The Chocolatier for lunch, but we ended up being early, so we had to hang around the gift shop for a while before we were seated. Lunch took rather a while, and was kind of expensive, but I think it was totally worth it. The others all had beers or other drinks, which they pronounced quite good. The menu has several items with either hints of chocolate or peanut butter, which we all assumed you wouldn\u2019t be able to really taste\u2026except we were totally wrong. It wasn\u2019t overpowering, just surprising little bursts while we ate. I really enjoyed this, much more than most park lunches, and I want to try this again. The only downer was that we didn\u2019t have room for dessert, not if we wanted to do more riding. I had wanted one of the giant milkshakes, which are served there, but it would have been a waste. Next time! Candymonium After lunch, Candymonium was reportedly down, so we couldn\u2019t ride it. We took a bathroom break, and while we were away, it came back up! So we had a much shorter line than expected, maybe about 15 minutes. So we all piled in, mostly toward the front, although I\u2019m not sure why. As hypers go, some of it was expected, some of it wasn\u2019t. The first drop was fine, but the terrain boosts the second hill giving some really sustained floater, which impressed me. I wished there\u2019d been room for another camelback before the turnaround, but it is what it is. The \u201cwave turn\u201d was something of a surprise, because I forgot it was there, and it\u2019s a strange feeling on a B&M, but it was nothing like an RMC wave turn. There\u2019s no mid-course, but there were a couple of trims that produced a noticeable tug, much to our disappointment. I think the final turn around the fountain is fun, not because it\u2019s intense or anything, it\u2019s just sweeping and panoramic, which is cool. I definitely want to get back on this some more. It likely won\u2019t displace any of my favorite hypers, but it\u2019s good for the middle of the pack, maybe a little above that. More Skyrush After Candymonium, we headed back toward Skyrush, and I took the opportunity to show off the path that the Findleys showed me years ago, which the others all appreciated. It\u2019s a really good part of the park for views of Skyrush, so that went over well. When we got back to Skyrush we found that it also had just come back up from a maintenance period, so it had no line at all! I was starting to develop a coaster headache, but I figured it would be OK if I rode one of the middle seats instead of the wing. Well, no, it doesn\u2019t make all that much difference. I still had trouble keeping my hands up, and my headache didn\u2019t get any better, so I sat out the next two rides the others took. After that, although it was only around 5:00, Bryant and his wife left, because they had to drive back to New England, and I decided to leave so I could have some evening time.","title":"HersheyPark"},{"location":"coasters/2022/hersheypark/#hersheypark","text":"Visited: July 17, 2022 Attending: Brian, Bryant (Coaster365), Meg, Matt, Gabby, Drew, Drew\u2019s partner The Buzzed Bars held a big trip to Poland in July 2022\u2026which lots of us couldn\u2019t go on.

We tried to get in a ride on Candymonium before lunch, but it was 2:00 at this point, and the line said it was 45 minutes, so we didn\u2019t think that would work.","title":"Skyrush"},{"location":"coasters/2022/hersheypark/#lunch","text":"Matt had made reservations at The Chocolatier for lunch, but we ended up being early, so we had to hang around the gift shop for a while before we were seated. Lunch took rather a while, and was kind of expensive, but I think it was totally worth it. The others all had beers or other drinks, which they pronounced quite good. The menu has several items with either hints of chocolate or peanut butter, which we all assumed you wouldn\u2019t be able to really taste\u2026except we were totally wrong. It wasn\u2019t overpowering, just surprising little bursts while we ate. I really enjoyed this, much more than most park lunches, and I want to try this again. The only downer was that we didn\u2019t have room for dessert, not if we wanted to do more riding. I had wanted one of the giant milkshakes, which are served there, but it would have been a waste. Next time!","title":"Lunch"},{"location":"coasters/2022/hersheypark/#candymonium","text":"After lunch, Candymonium was reportedly down, so we couldn\u2019t ride it. We took a bathroom break, and while we were away, it came back up! So we had a much shorter line than expected, maybe about 15 minutes. So we all piled in, mostly toward the front, although I\u2019m not sure why. As hypers go, some of it was expected, some of it wasn\u2019t. The first drop was fine, but the terrain boosts the second hill giving some really sustained floater, which impressed me. I wished there\u2019d been room for another camelback before the turnaround, but it is what it is. The \u201cwave turn\u201d was something of a surprise, because I forgot it was there, and it\u2019s a strange feeling on a B&M, but it was nothing like an RMC wave turn. There\u2019s no mid-course, but there were a couple of trims that produced a noticeable tug, much to our disappointment. I think the final turn around the fountain is fun, not because it\u2019s intense or anything, it\u2019s just sweeping and panoramic, which is cool. I definitely want to get back on this some more. It likely won\u2019t displace any of my favorite hypers, but it\u2019s good for the middle of the pack, maybe a little above that.","title":"Candymonium"},{"location":"coasters/2022/hersheypark/#more-skyrush","text":"After Candymonium, we headed back toward Skyrush, and I took the opportunity to show off the path that the Findleys showed me years ago, which the others all appreciated. It\u2019s a really good part of the park for views of Skyrush, so that went over well. When we got back to Skyrush we found that it also had just come back up from a maintenance period, so it had no line at all! I was starting to develop a coaster headache, but I figured it would be OK if I rode one of the middle seats instead of the wing. Well, no, it doesn\u2019t make all that much difference. I still had trouble keeping my hands up, and my headache didn\u2019t get any better, so I sat out the next two rides the others took. After that, although it was only around 5:00, Bryant and his wife left, because they had to drive back to New England, and I decided to leave so I could have some evening time.","title":"More Skyrush"},{"location":"coasters/2022/kennywood/","text":"Kennywood Visited: July 28, 2022 Attending: Brian and Doug I turned 50 in June, and then Doug in July, so we decided we should do a thing to celebrate.

We splurged on Cedar Fair Platinum passes to make the trip easier, and then on FastLane passes to make it even easier. Things went well, if not exactly as planned.

Phantom\u2019s Revenge When we got into the park, we went straight to Steel Curtain, but it was opening late. So we headed over to Phantom\u2019s Revenge as the second highest priority. I\u2019d ridden this one in 2019, but only the once, so I was excited to get back on it. I made sure to leave myself some room in the seat belt, because the buzz bar does nothing. As usual, the ride doesn\u2019t really start until the second drop, and it\u2019s just as crazy fast as I remembered. However, the airtime was just OK, barring the last few bunny hills. Thunderbolt Thunderbolt is right by Phantom\u2019s Revenge, and it uses the same ravine, so we went there next. The layout is unusual, because of the way it uses the terrain. It drops right out of the station into the ravine, then turns around and does it again before there\u2019s a lift hill. A couple of turns around the station, then it\u2019s back into the ravine again. A very strange layout all told, but the uniqueness works in its favor.

I\u2019d never been here before, but I did have some sense of the park from looking at the maps, and from Kings Dominion. We were regarding this evening time as kind of a bonus, with the real work taking place the next day. Didn\u2019t go quite the way we planned, though. Orion Fortunately, the Orion area wasn\u2019t all that crowded, and while we had to wait a bit, it wasn\u2019t so bad. The sun started to go down as we got to the platform, so this was more of a twilight ride than anything else. As gigas go\u2026Orion makes a good hyper. The first drop down below ground level is fun, but it\u2019s not like Fury\u2019s (or i305, or Millennium Force). I do like the second hill rising out of the ditch. It reminded me of Candymonium in that regard, as you just climb up and up and up getting you set for all that floater over the top\u2026and then it tilts sideways, which is odd. And then the next hill is a turnaround. I realize that even a park like this has finite space, but a straight camelback with floater really would have been great. The speed hill on the way back is a lot of fun, a proper camelback with its floater, a helix that serves no purpose, and then something that\u2019s supposed to be a wave turn but really isn\u2019t. The rise into the brake run is probably the single best airtime pop on the ride, which is unfortunate. I\u2019m sure B&M has a reason why the brake run has to be so high and so long, but darned if I know what it is. The Beast Having accomplished Orion, which was the biggest priority, we knew that we needed to get a night ride on the Beast, as we weren\u2019t likely to be around after dark on Saturday. The line, unfortunately, was formidable, but we figured it would move reasonably fast. We were wrong. As we were on our final approach to the station, they shut down the ride for the nightly fireworks show. (While seeing fireworks from Beast would be awesome, they\u2019re launched from inside the infield, so that\u2019s a no-go.) So we were stuck in one spot, spitting distance from the platform, for about an hour. Worse, that area is covered, so we couldn\u2019t see the fireworks or the drone show, which I\u2019m told is quite good. Regardless, we did eventually get to ride, and had no trouble obtaining the back row. Then\u2026things happened. I mean, I know they did because I was there, but darned if I have any idea what those things were, because it was pitch black. It\u2019s a little rough, it\u2019s rumbly, and it\u2019s absurdly long.

We got Fast Lane here again, because we figured it would be needed on a Saturday, even though there\u2019s less of a Platinum discount at this park. It was a nice day, sunny, but not overly hot for July. The goal, again, was to rack up all the credits. Orion Since we were not only Fast-Passing, but also had early admission thanks to our platinum status, we headed right for Orion as the biggest attraction in the park. We went front and back again, to make sure we\u2019d covered the bases, and\u2026it was fine. I mean, it\u2019s nice and tall, and it\u2019s a good B&M, but it just lacks anything particularly special to put it over the top. It doesn\u2019t do any single thing exceptionally; it just does everything fine. If Orion were the first giga I\u2019d encountered, I might be more impressed. It\u2019s genera giga. Does what it says on the tin. Flight of Fear Flight of Fear is next to Orion, so we did that next. I got to explain to Doug everything I knew about the history of the ride, and my horrible experience with it at Kings Dominion. However, since I expunged that demon a few years ago, this clone version didn\u2019t really do anything for me. I did notice that the interior of the building had a bit more light in it than the KD version that I remember, but other than that, there\u2019s nothing particularly special going on here. Racer Getting out of Area 72 requires passing underneath Racer, so we went and did that next. I\u2019d ridden Racer 75 at Kings Dominion, and I figured this would be similar, in the sense that wooden coasters with only straightaway can be pretty smooth. Oh, I was wrong about that. This one was seriously rough and bumpy, even on the straight sections. Other than that, it goes out, it comes back. Nothing much to say about that. Banshee From there, we passed into the northern section of the park, where Banshee lives. Banshee was one of my main interest points for this park, because it\u2019s divisive: Some people really like it, whereas others think it\u2019s dull and forceless, and a hallmark of the \u201cnew,\u201d less intense B&M designs. Doug and I both really like a good invert, as we have fond memories of riding Batman in its first season. So I wasn\u2019t really sure what to expect from this. At my recommendation, we went front-row, because that\u2019s my preferred way to do an invert for the first time. In the end, I really liked it. It\u2019s massive, so the elements aren\u2019t packed quite so tightly as Batman, but there\u2019s very little dead time. The inversions take good advantage of their height to come way down toward the ground, and the front is a great place to see it all from. I thought it was quite forceful, and I liked it a lot. We also had a new rider in the front row with us, a Dad who apparently wasn\u2019t much for coasters, but he handled this one like a champ. The Bat The Bat is more a historical artifact to me than a coaster, exactly. I know the story of the original Kings Island Bat, and I know this one is different, but it\u2019s still interesting. The station is an absurdly long way away from anything else. In fact, I imagine it\u2019s probably difficult to find if you\u2019re not looking for it. That probably contributed to the very short line we encountered. It has the same cars as Iron Dragon, which Doug fit in only awkwardly, so I\u2019m not sure he was a big fan. However, compared to Iron Dragon and Ninja, it makes much better use of its terrain, which is interesting, because there\u2019s not really a lot of terrain going on at this park. It\u2019s photogenic, but not really all that intense. Invertigo Having made it back out of the hidden section, we decided to get Invertigo next. Doug regarded it as just an ordinary Boomerang, inverted or not. Personally, knowing how few of these there are remaining made me a bit interested. Bottom line, it\u2019s not really all that exciting. It had an unusually long line, even in Fast Lane, which was odd. We were also paired with a young girl who looked like she just barely met the height requirements, and seemed to be riding by herself, for some reason. She didn\u2019t look scared, but also didn\u2019t look too excited. Lunch was at the Chicken Shack, which was better than I expected, although we went there more by convenience than choice. We noticed the crowds were starting to arrive, and the rest of the afternoon slowed down a bit, even with the Fast Lane. Adventure Express This is the Arrow mine train that every park has one of, but it\u2019s a credit, so we had to get it. And it had been closed the first time we went past, so we didn\u2019t want to miss out. It\u2019s mostly a standard mine train, although admittedly more wooded than most, right up until the end. There\u2019s a second lift, which goes indoors, and suddenly there\u2019s a lot of temple theming, and even animatronics, and then\u2026it\u2019s over. I have no idea why the theming is only at the end, but there it is. It probably would be utterly forgettable, except that we got off saying, \u201cWhat? What just happened? Why?\u201d Backlot Stunt Coaster Speaking of theming, there\u2019s this clone. I\u2019ve ridden the one at Kings Dominion, and I thought it was more impressive when it was new, and had the \u201cItalian Job\u201d branding on it. So I was prepared to be underwhelmed, and in fact I kept forgetting that this coaster was even on our list. Fortunately, it\u2019s right in the middle of the park, so it was hard to miss. I was pleasantly surprised with this version, as all the special effects were running, which made the ride a lot more enjoyable. It\u2019s still more dark ride than coaster, but that first helix is no joke. Diamondback Diamondback is pretty easy to see from Backlot, so we thought we could just head right there. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no direct route, so we ended up detouring through Planet Snoopy inadvertently. I\u2019d only heard good things about Diamondback in the past, that it was the best B&M hyper until Mako came along. I\u2019ve realized that what I want out of a hyper is a big, straight camelback with lots of floater, and Diamondback\u2019s just weren\u2019t hitting right. You can see in a PoV that there should be plenty of nice floater moments, but they just weren\u2019t happening. We were in the back row, and the staggered seating meant that we had the outside corners, but we didn\u2019t get the experience we expected. The splashdown was kind of neat, I thought, although Doug didn\u2019t agree. Being in the very back meant we got a little wet, which was kind of nice, in my opinion. I still can\u2019t figure out why this one didn\u2019t work for us. Maybe it\u2019s a front-row ride. Mystic Timbers Mystic Timbers is also a bit hidden, but we found it. I didn\u2019t really know what to expect from this one, because I\u2019ve heard mixed opinions, and the stats aren\u2019t all that impressive. However, I was really impressed with the layout. It was wild, but not too rough. The twister section near the turnaround seemed blazingly fast. GCI has really mastered their niche with this one, although lateral forces aren\u2019t Doug\u2019s favorite thing. And then there\u2019s the shed\u2026which was entirely underwhelming. I still have no idea what was supposed to be in the shed, but we didn\u2019t get much. Which is a shame, because without the shed, it would just be a great small-scale wooden. Beast (again) Mystic Timbers isn\u2019t far from Beast, and since we\u2019d knocked out all the credits, riding the Beast in daylight was the next highest priority. And\u2026it was good. But that\u2019s about it. Back in the woods, and it was kinda confusing, and it was nice to be able to see the big turn that leads into the helix tunnel, but that\u2019s about it. It\u2019s a good wooden, especially for its time, and no one can deny it\u2019s a long ride. But the night ride is what makes it next-level. It was fun to take the Fast Lane route to the station, because it let us see parts of the queue that we couldn\u2019t see the night before, or had seen, but didn\u2019t know what they were. Which is a tiny thing, but entertaining. It was mid-afternoon at this point, and we found ourselves at a bit of a loose end. We weren\u2019t sure what to hit up for re-rides, especially since Diamondback disappointed. And we may have been getting a bit weary after three days of parks. So we did something I\u2019ve never done at Kings Dominion, and we went up the Eiffel Tower. It\u2019s really nicely tall, and well-placed on a slight rise. I enjoyed getting to see the layout from the air, and identifying the shot of Mystic Timbers that Jack took once upon a time. We took a bunch of photos and then decided that we could leave early and try to make it home late that night, instead of waiting until Sunday. That meant missing a second chance at Kennywood, but we agreed it was more important for Doug to get home. Banshee (again) We decided that our final ride would be on Banshee, back row this time. I\u2019m still holding to my opinion that it\u2019s more forceful than everybody claims it is. We got some solid g\u2019s through the low swoops, kind of like a B&M flyer, really. And without being able to see it coming, that last zero-g roll is a nice, sharp surprise. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s my favorite in the park, but it\u2019s probably top three. And from there, we headed out while there was still daylight. That\u2019s still a good 8 hours, so we stopped a couple of times, and I didn\u2019t go down into Cincinnati to get a Hard Rock pin like I\u2019d imagined. A bit shorter of a trip than originally planned, but still pretty darned good. I got to introduce Doug to Cedar Point, take him on his first RMC, and his first giga. And Kings Island was new to both of us, so that was cool. Kennywood is cementing itself as my nemesis, though, and Steel Curtain in particular.","title":"Kings Island"},{"location":"coasters/2022/kingsisland2/#kings-island","text":"Visited: July 30, 2022 Attending: Brian and Doug The next day, we had a nice breakfast at the hotel, then headed over to the park.

It\u2019s massive, so the elements aren\u2019t packed quite so tightly as Batman, but there\u2019s very little dead time. The inversions take good advantage of their height to come way down toward the ground, and the front is a great place to see it all from. I thought it was quite forceful, and I liked it a lot. We also had a new rider in the front row with us, a Dad who apparently wasn\u2019t much for coasters, but he handled this one like a champ.","title":"Banshee"},{"location":"coasters/2022/kingsisland2/#the-bat","text":"The Bat is more a historical artifact to me than a coaster, exactly. I know the story of the original Kings Island Bat, and I know this one is different, but it\u2019s still interesting. The station is an absurdly long way away from anything else. In fact, I imagine it\u2019s probably difficult to find if you\u2019re not looking for it. That probably contributed to the very short line we encountered. It has the same cars as Iron Dragon, which Doug fit in only awkwardly, so I\u2019m not sure he was a big fan. However, compared to Iron Dragon and Ninja, it makes much better use of its terrain, which is interesting, because there\u2019s not really a lot of terrain going on at this park. It\u2019s photogenic, but not really all that intense.","title":"The Bat"},{"location":"coasters/2022/kingsisland2/#invertigo","text":"Having made it back out of the hidden section, we decided to get Invertigo next. Doug regarded it as just an ordinary Boomerang, inverted or not. Personally, knowing how few of these there are remaining made me a bit interested. Bottom line, it\u2019s not really all that exciting. It had an unusually long line, even in Fast Lane, which was odd. We were also paired with a young girl who looked like she just barely met the height requirements, and seemed to be riding by herself, for some reason. She didn\u2019t look scared, but also didn\u2019t look too excited. Lunch was at the Chicken Shack, which was better than I expected, although we went there more by convenience than choice. We noticed the crowds were starting to arrive, and the rest of the afternoon slowed down a bit, even with the Fast Lane.","title":"Invertigo"},{"location":"coasters/2022/kingsisland2/#adventure-express","text":"This is the Arrow mine train that every park has one of, but it\u2019s a credit, so we had to get it. And it had been closed the first time we went past, so we didn\u2019t want to miss out. It\u2019s mostly a standard mine train, although admittedly more wooded than most, right up until the end. There\u2019s a second lift, which goes indoors, and suddenly there\u2019s a lot of temple theming, and even animatronics, and then\u2026it\u2019s over. I have no idea why the theming is only at the end, but there it is. It probably would be utterly forgettable, except that we got off saying, \u201cWhat? What just happened? Why?\u201d","title":"Adventure Express"},{"location":"coasters/2022/kingsisland2/#backlot-stunt-coaster","text":"Speaking of theming, there\u2019s this clone. I\u2019ve ridden the one at Kings Dominion, and I thought it was more impressive when it was new, and had the \u201cItalian Job\u201d branding on it. So I was prepared to be underwhelmed, and in fact I kept forgetting that this coaster was even on our list. Fortunately, it\u2019s right in the middle of the park, so it was hard to miss. I was pleasantly surprised with this version, as all the special effects were running, which made the ride a lot more enjoyable. It\u2019s still more dark ride than coaster, but that first helix is no joke.","title":"Backlot Stunt Coaster"},{"location":"coasters/2022/kingsisland2/#diamondback","text":"Diamondback is pretty easy to see from Backlot, so we thought we could just head right there. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no direct route, so we ended up detouring through Planet Snoopy inadvertently. I\u2019d only heard good things about Diamondback in the past, that it was the best B&M hyper until Mako came along. I\u2019ve realized that what I want out of a hyper is a big, straight camelback with lots of floater, and Diamondback\u2019s just weren\u2019t hitting right. You can see in a PoV that there should be plenty of nice floater moments, but they just weren\u2019t happening. We were in the back row, and the staggered seating meant that we had the outside corners, but we didn\u2019t get the experience we expected. The splashdown was kind of neat, I thought, although Doug didn\u2019t agree. Being in the very back meant we got a little wet, which was kind of nice, in my opinion. I still can\u2019t figure out why this one didn\u2019t work for us. Maybe it\u2019s a front-row ride.","title":"Diamondback"},{"location":"coasters/2022/kingsisland2/#mystic-timbers","text":"Mystic Timbers is also a bit hidden, but we found it. I didn\u2019t really know what to expect from this one, because I\u2019ve heard mixed opinions, and the stats aren\u2019t all that impressive. However, I was really impressed with the layout. It was wild, but not too rough. The twister section near the turnaround seemed blazingly fast. GCI has really mastered their niche with this one, although lateral forces aren\u2019t Doug\u2019s favorite thing. And then there\u2019s the shed\u2026which was entirely underwhelming. I still have no idea what was supposed to be in the shed, but we didn\u2019t get much.

Back in the woods, and it was kinda confusing, and it was nice to be able to see the big turn that leads into the helix tunnel, but that\u2019s about it. It\u2019s a good wooden, especially for its time, and no one can deny it\u2019s a long ride. But the night ride is what makes it next-level. It was fun to take the Fast Lane route to the station, because it let us see parts of the queue that we couldn\u2019t see the night before, or had seen, but didn\u2019t know what they were. Which is a tiny thing, but entertaining. It was mid-afternoon at this point, and we found ourselves at a bit of a loose end. We weren\u2019t sure what to hit up for re-rides, especially since Diamondback disappointed. And we may have been getting a bit weary after three days of parks. So we did something I\u2019ve never done at Kings Dominion, and we went up the Eiffel Tower. It\u2019s really nicely tall, and well-placed on a slight rise. I enjoyed getting to see the layout from the air, and identifying the shot of Mystic Timbers that Jack took once upon a time. We took a bunch of photos and then decided that we could leave early and try to make it home late that night, instead of waiting until Sunday. That meant missing a second chance at Kennywood, but we agreed it was more important for Doug to get home.","title":"Beast (again)"},{"location":"coasters/2022/kingsisland2/#banshee-again","text":"We decided that our final ride would be on Banshee, back row this time. I\u2019m still holding to my opinion that it\u2019s more forceful than everybody claims it is. We got some solid g\u2019s through the low swoops, kind of like a B&M flyer, really. And without being able to see it coming, that last zero-g roll is a nice, sharp surprise. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s my favorite in the park, but it\u2019s probably top three. And from there, we headed out while there was still daylight. That\u2019s still a good 8 hours, so we stopped a couple of times, and I didn\u2019t go down into Cincinnati to get a Hard Rock pin like I\u2019d imagined. A bit shorter of a trip than originally planned, but still pretty darned good. I got to introduce Doug to Cedar Point, take him on his first RMC, and his first giga.

There was some issue with pricing early on, and one or more of the coasters always seems to have maintenance problems. But on this day, all five were running, and the club took advantage. I took a short two-hour drive up the New Jersey Turnpike and met folks in the parking garage. Eventually, we made it inside, and even more eventually, we found the park sometime around 12:30. The park is very visually impressive, loud and colorful, and of course being indoors magnifies the sound. It wasn\u2019t too crowded when we arrived, but filled up later in the day. Despite being indoors, there are large windows facing east, and the park was quite well lit. I was surprised that although the park has strong theming to kids\u2019 cartoons, four out of the five coasters were pretty extreme. Even several of the flat rides seemed extreme to me. There were some kiddie rides, but almost nothing in the middle range. We initially got in line for Slime Streak, but folks who\u2019d been there before concluded the line would take 45 minutes from that point, so we decided to leave it for later. Sandy\u2019s Blasting Bronco This was the one coaster that I knew nothing about going in, as it\u2019s the only one that doesn\u2019t have a counterpart at Mall of America. Pretty much the only things I\u2019d heard about it was that it was the last coaster to open, and it was frequently down. So I had no idea what to expect, other than that it had some backwards elements. It\u2019s a fairly small Intamin, and basically looks like a few loops next to each other. Which pretty much describes it. There\u2019s an LSM launch straight into an immelman, then a dive, another immelman, and a slow rollover, then back to the start. Not very notable, except at that point, the entire loading area is on a turntable, which rotates 180 degrees, and then launches you through the ride again, except facing backward. I\u2019ve gotten to do some backward launches recently, but this was just kinda strange. And made me rather dizzy. It\u2019s an interesting ride on a tiny footprint, which makes me surprised there aren\u2019t more of these. It\u2019s well in the back of this park, and folks didn\u2019t seem to be able to find it, so it had very little line. TMNT Shellraiser Shellraiser was my highest priority for the day, so we went over there next, and I was blessed with a walk-on. It\u2019s a Gerstlaur Euro-Fighter model, which I\u2019ve ridden before, but it happens to have the steepest drop in the world at 121.5 degrees. (It\u2019s a clone of Takabisha in Japan.) I\u2019d also heard it was unusually rough, especially in the back. The cars are tiny, two rows of four, and I drew the front row all the way on the left, so I was off to the side of the track. I\u2019m not really sure if that explains what went wrong, but I didn\u2019t enjoy it much. There was an almost immediate rattle that jarred my teeth and threatened to give me a headache. Which is a shame, because the layout is unusual, if not really creative. There\u2019s a jojo roll out of the station, which I normally appreciate. Then a straightaway with LSMs to launch into the first few loops of the ride. Which is odd, because there\u2019s a vertical lift hill, but it\u2019s in the middle of the course. The lift goes up above the roof of the park, into a cut-out with windows that face east, so you can see the Manhattan skyline while it hangs you there, Hang-Time style. The drop is just a drop\u2026if you\u2019ve done one beyond-vertical, this is pretty much the same. I really wish I knew what caused me to be so uncomfortable, because I think I disliked this more than I should have. It was around 2:00 at this point, and Matt declared he was hungry. I\u2019d had a filling breakfast, but I thought maybe hunger was causing my problem too. Given that the remaining two coasters were spinners, I thought it best to get something to eat. Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t realize that Matt intended a sit-down restaurant, so the lunch break was longer than I expected, but the barbecue chicken quesadilla was pretty good. Shredder After my extended break, the half-pipe was down for a while, so I gravitated toward Shredder. It\u2019s a Gerstlauer spinner, a clone of the one at Mall of America, and heavily intertwined with Shellraiser. On Gerstlauer spinners, the riders face the middle of the car, which I find less exciting than other models. There were four of us in the party, so we tried to arrange seating so there\u2019d be a weight imbalance, but that turned out to be futile. We barely got any spinning at all, except for a few swoops around big curves. Matt was very disappointed, but I was just kind of \u201cmeh\u201d about the whole thing. Timmy\u2019s Half-Pipe Havoc While we were riding Shredder, the half-pipe reopened, and somehow Matt finagled us totally unnecessary skip-the-line treatment, so we rode in two batches. I wasn\u2019t real fond of the half-pipe at Mall of America, possibly because I\u2019d never done anything like it before, but this one didn\u2019t seem nearly as intimidating. It\u2019s the same size (20m), but seemed a little more wedged-in than the other. Perhaps because I knew what to expect, I enjoyed this one more than my previous ride. There\u2019s not a ton to say about it; it just goes back and forth. The spinning seemed less intense, but I\u2019m not sure that was it. I\u2019d ride one of these again, but there\u2019s only two in the US for the moment. At that point it was getting close to 5:00, and most of the crew were thinking about rolling out to get to the bar that constituted the next part of the evening.

I was in San Diego for a Marketing department off-site meeting, which was slated for all of two days, barely worth it. However, I went out a day early, anticipating team activities that didn\u2019t really happen. I had originally hoped to take some of my team to Magic Mountain or Knotts, but I couldn\u2019t make the logistics work. So I found myself on Sunday evening with not much to do. SeaWorld was open for another two hours, so I figured I could sweep up the credits and bail. I wasn\u2019t expecting very much, and mostly I was right, but it was a little better than my low expectations. Emperor Emperor was my primary interest at SeaWorld, which indicates how little I was expecting, because dive coasters are far from my favorite. But I\u2019d heard good things about this one, and I was curious. I knew that SWSD hadn\u2019t been designed with coasters in mind, and didn\u2019t have a ton of space to work with, so they\u2019re kind of awkwardly placed. I\u2019m also pretty sure the park wasn\u2019t designed for operations after dark, because although there weren\u2019t dark areas as such, the paths seemed a bit tricky to navigate, and it wasn\u2019t always clear where to go next. Without the app on my phone, I\u2019d have had a hard time finding the ride. Unfortunately, the app let me down in a different respect. Before I\u2019d arrived at the park, the app showed a wait time of 10 minutes. When I got there, the sign on the ride said 35, which was more accurate. I was surrounded by teenagers having remarkably inane conversation, but that\u2019s the price I pay. I got the back row, outside right seat, which seemed like a very good choice. Emperor is shorter than Valravn or Griffon, the other two dive coasters I\u2019ve done, but 50 feet doesn\u2019t make a ton of difference when you\u2019re hanging. However, sitting in the back row does make a difference, because you\u2019re not really hanging, just waiting. I got a nice pop of air going over the drop, but it\u2019s very brief. The rest of the ride is pretty good, for a dive coaster. There\u2019s no mid-course, and therefore no second drop, but there is a variety of elements. The footprint is still pretty small, and there\u2019s nothing else around, so I think this might be the rare ride that isn\u2019t better after dark. I wouldn\u2019t have minded a second ride to appreciate the second part of the ride more, but not with the ops running like they were that night. Manta Next I headed all the way over to the other side of the park\u2026getting lost a couple of times, and having to use the map, which was dangerous as my phone battery was very low. Eventually I found the entrance, got in the queue, and walked, and walked, and walked almost to the station. The amount of queue for this ride is kind of ridiculous. None of it is cattle-chutes, so it\u2019s not quite as bad as it looks, but I can imagine the line being a couple of hours, especially when it was new. Anyway, I had no idea what to expect of Manta, other than it was probably a launch coaster, because I couldn\u2019t see a lift hill. The queue and station were gorgeously decorated, mostly with pictures of mantas, but I like mantas, so it\u2019s all good. I snagged the last row and waited to see what happened. What happened was we rolled out into a tunnel with a video display wrapped around it. I imagine it normally shows images of waves or mantas or something, but because it was Christmas, it was showing a variety of colored lights and had \u201cThe Wizard in Winter\u201d by Trans-Siberian Orchestra playing. I\u2019ve heard that used on a coaster before, at Knotts, but I wasn\u2019t expecting it at SeaWorld, for some reason. The launch was a standard Mack launch, nothing too intense. The rest of the ride was rather fitting to the theme \u2013 low to the ground, lots of swooping, and a couple of directional changes that Intamin could appreciate, if not be impressed by. On the whole, it was much better than I\u2019d anticipated, but then again, I hadn\u2019t really anticipated anything. I\u2019d be happy to ride it multiple times, except I didn\u2019t really have time for that. While it\u2019s not a kiddie coaster, it\u2019s definitely on the milder side, and I probably would have been disappointed if I\u2019d waited a couple of hours for it. Now for the things I didn\u2019t ride: * Electric Eel was closed for annual maintenance, which I knew before arriving at the park, although not before the trip itself. So I still haven\u2019t ridden a Sky Rocket II. * Journey to Atlantis is a water coaster, and I really didn\u2019t feel like getting wet. San Diego may be temperate, but at night in December is pushing things. * Tidal Twister isn\u2019t a coaster. I saw it, and it was running, but looking at it briefly didn\u2019t convince me that it\u2019s really a credit. If it had been a walk-on, I might have gone for it, but I was on my way out of the park at that point.","title":"SeaWorld San Diego"},{"location":"coasters/2022/seaworldsandiego/#seaworld-san-diego","text":"Visited: December 4, 2022 Attending: Just Brian This visit was the definition of a fly-by.

I\u2019m also pretty sure the park wasn\u2019t designed for operations after dark, because although there weren\u2019t dark areas as such, the paths seemed a bit tricky to navigate, and it wasn\u2019t always clear where to go next. Without the app on my phone, I\u2019d have had a hard time finding the ride. Unfortunately, the app let me down in a different respect. Before I\u2019d arrived at the park, the app showed a wait time of 10 minutes. When I got there, the sign on the ride said 35, which was more accurate. I was surrounded by teenagers having remarkably inane conversation, but that\u2019s the price I pay. I got the back row, outside right seat, which seemed like a very good choice. Emperor is shorter than Valravn or Griffon, the other two dive coasters I\u2019ve done, but 50 feet doesn\u2019t make a ton of difference when you\u2019re hanging. However, sitting in the back row does make a difference, because you\u2019re not really hanging, just waiting. I got a nice pop of air going over the drop, but it\u2019s very brief. The rest of the ride is pretty good, for a dive coaster. There\u2019s no mid-course, and therefore no second drop, but there is a variety of elements. The footprint is still pretty small, and there\u2019s nothing else around, so I think this might be the rare ride that isn\u2019t better after dark. I wouldn\u2019t have minded a second ride to appreciate the second part of the ride more, but not with the ops running like they were that night.","title":"Emperor"},{"location":"coasters/2022/seaworldsandiego/#manta","text":"Next I headed all the way over to the other side of the park\u2026getting lost a couple of times, and having to use the map, which was dangerous as my phone battery was very low. Eventually I found the entrance, got in the queue, and walked, and walked, and walked almost to the station. The amount of queue for this ride is kind of ridiculous. None of it is cattle-chutes, so it\u2019s not quite as bad as it looks, but I can imagine the line being a couple of hours, especially when it was new. Anyway, I had no idea what to expect of Manta, other than it was probably a launch coaster, because I couldn\u2019t see a lift hill. The queue and station were gorgeously decorated, mostly with pictures of mantas, but I like mantas, so it\u2019s all good. I snagged the last row and waited to see what happened. What happened was we rolled out into a tunnel with a video display wrapped around it. I imagine it normally shows images of waves or mantas or something, but because it was Christmas, it was showing a variety of colored lights and had \u201cThe Wizard in Winter\u201d by Trans-Siberian Orchestra playing. I\u2019ve heard that used on a coaster before, at Knotts, but I wasn\u2019t expecting it at SeaWorld, for some reason. The launch was a standard Mack launch, nothing too intense. The rest of the ride was rather fitting to the theme \u2013 low to the ground, lots of swooping, and a couple of directional changes that Intamin could appreciate, if not be impressed by. On the whole, it was much better than I\u2019d anticipated, but then again, I hadn\u2019t really anticipated anything. I\u2019d be happy to ride it multiple times, except I didn\u2019t really have time for that. While it\u2019s not a kiddie coaster, it\u2019s definitely on the milder side, and I probably would have been disappointed if I\u2019d waited a couple of hours for it. Now for the things I didn\u2019t ride: * Electric Eel was closed for annual maintenance, which I knew before arriving at the park, although not before the trip itself. So I still haven\u2019t ridden a Sky Rocket II. * Journey to Atlantis is a water coaster, and I really didn\u2019t feel like getting wet. San Diego may be temperate, but at night in December is pushing things. * Tidal Twister isn\u2019t a coaster. I saw it, and it was running, but looking at it briefly didn\u2019t convince me that it\u2019s really a credit. If it had been a walk-on, I might have gone for it, but I was on my way out of the park at that point.","title":"Manta"},{"location":"coasters/2022/sixflagsgreatadventure/","text":"Six Flags Great Adventure Visited: December 29, 2022 Attending: Just Brian I didn\u2019t even realize that I hadn\u2019t been to Great Adventure at all in 2022. It was a pretty good coaster year for me in all other respects, so I didn\u2019t notice. However, I bought a Six Flags Diamond Pass for 2023, and I remembered that in past years, you needed to pick up your pass in person at the park. Since I\u2019m planning on a Magic Mountain trip in February, my only chance to pick it up would be this week. That turned out not to be the case, as Six Flags has lightened up a bit, and embraced the mobile app, but I still felt more comfortable having a physical card. And I needed to go to Bonnie\u2019s to drop off some presents, which isn\u2019t really anywhere near Great Adventure, but qualifies as \u201cin Jersey,\u201d so I figured I\u2019d stop by for a bit. My last trip to Great Adventure during Holiday in the Park was disappointing, so I wasn\u2019t really expecting much. Still, it was sunny, with temps around 50, so worth a try. Several coasters were closed for the season: Kingda Ka, El Toro, Medusa, and Green Lantern, so I figured I could just avoid that half of the park. Jersey Devil Remembering my experience from the previous year, I decided to empty my pockets completely before visiting Jersey Devil, which may not have been necessary, but was convenient, as I found a bank of lockers halfway between Jersey Devil and Nitro. The line was pretty short, mostly in the station, and the continuous feed made it move along nicely. I got a seat in the back half, maybe row 8 or 9, which was good enough. I was surprised by the speed and intensity of this ride, compared to my previous rides on it. I also expected it to be a little sluggish because of the temperatures, but it was actually moving at quite a clip. If the mid-course brakes hit at all, I didn\u2019t notice them. Strong positives through the turnarounds, and the stall felt about as good as any other RMC stall, so that was cool. I probably could\u2019ve gone around again, but I had other things to do. Nitro Nitro was also a station wait. I\u2019d worried it might not have been, since there was little else open in the park, but Nitro still gets no love. I snagged the back row pretty easily, and only had to wait a couple of cycles. I sat on the right edge, which I normally don\u2019t, but there\u2019s no real reason for that. On my last winter ride on Nitro, I was badly disappointed in how sluggish it was. This time was a distinct improvement. It wasn\u2019t quite at its middle of summer best, but it was only a little bit off of that. I felt some odd positive G\u2019s coming out of the hammerhead that I normally don\u2019t feel, so that was different. The airtime over the bunny hills was fun, and on the whole, it was a decent experience. I thought about riding Batman, but I didn\u2019t want to stay too late. On the whole, I was there less than an hour, and it was a fairly pleasant experience. Not bad for a December visit.","title":"Six Flags Great Adventure"},{"location":"coasters/2022/sixflagsgreatadventure/#six-flags-great-adventure","text":"Visited: December 29, 2022 Attending: Just Brian I didn\u2019t even realize that I hadn\u2019t been to Great Adventure at all in 2022.

I was switching over to the realm of Disney, where the coasters are less technically impressive, but superior in terms of theming. It's also logistically more complicated, with virtual queues, lightning lanes, and genie plusses. Fortunately, I had a guide in the form of Steven from Buzzed Bars, Orlando resident, season pass holder, and most important, Dis-nerd. I ended up doing a lot of things that weren't coasters, so this part of the report is gonna be a bit different. Flight of Passage I met Steven outside security just around opening. I didn't wait long, but long enough to see that the crowds were heavier than I had anticipated. I didn't really know what a light crowd looks like in Orlando, but this didn't look like it. Although Flight of Passage isn't a coaster, it's the most popular thing in Animal Kingdom, and I rather wanted to do it, so it made sense to go there first, even with a two-hour posted wait time. The line in fact was outside the normal queue and out onto the paths, with cast members keeping it straight. We weren't outside for too terribly long,and the floating boulders provided some shade. Once we got inside, it was much cooler. Steven and I are both enthusiasts, and we hadn't seen each other in some time, so there was plenty to talk about while we waited. Although the queue was long, it moved steadily, which was good. I might have even wanted more time to look at the theming decorations, although there were also long bare stretches. Eventually we got divided into groups of 16, and got our training video on how to be a Na'vi avatar. Which is basically nothing; you just sit on a \"chair,\" which is more like straddling a horse, which is certainly appropriate. You lean in so that the seat constricts your chest and legs, so you can feel your ikran breathe and flex beneath you, at least a little. There are 3D glasses, but they're pretty light and unobtrusive. It's not an individual experience as I'd hoped, but rather eight folks sharing a screen, not unlike Soarin\u2019, but smaller scale. It succeeded in filling my range of vision nicely. The chairs tilt forward and back, possibly side to side, to give the illusion of flight, but that's not quite so convincing. I suspect it doesn't really tilt that far forward. There are smells pumped in, but they're mostly subtle. It's kind of hard to notice them. There are several spots where a water spray or mist would be appropriate, but there wasn't one. As for the story, you go for a flight. That's it. I expected the usual \"something has gone wrong\" plot that simulators often have, but they didn't. In fact, the absence of that trope was surprising in itself. The experience was satisfying without being mind-blowing. It was about as I'd heard it described. Having just seen the movie, I could wish for something a bit more immersive, but I\u2019m not sure how that would be accomplished. Expedition: Everest Although Flight of Passage was my primary interest, the coaster I was there to ride was Expedition: Everest. I\u2019m honestly not sure why I didn\u2019t ride this in 2011; maybe I didn\u2019t know it was there. With Steven to guide me, it didn\u2019t take long to get over there, and the wait was moderate, maybe about 30 minutes. There were certainly a lot of things to look at in the line, and I might have wanted to examine them more closely, but the queue kept moving steadily. The trains are kind of funny, blocky, but thematic. They\u2019re not what I would have expected from a modern coaster designer like Vekoma. Then again, there\u2019s nothing about this ride that says \u201cVekoma\u201d in any way. The lift hill is absurdly steep, almost like an alpine coaster. But the drop, well, there isn\u2019t one, really. Just a lot of swooping around in the dark. Then, of course, there\u2019s the dead-end track and the backwards bit. I knew that was going to happen, but I didn\u2019t know exactly when or where. The backwards bit goes on for rather longer than I expected. Helixes are about all I remember about this coaster, because that\u2019s what it\u2019s got: helixes, mostly in the dark. It\u2019s unexpected, because it\u2019s telling a story, rather than adhering to any standards of \u201chow a roller coaster should go.\u201d From a strictly enthusiast level, it\u2019s no more exciting than a mine train. As an experience, though, it\u2019s pretty cool. On Steven\u2019s advice, we planned to leave for Epcot as early as possible, but we still couldn\u2019t enter there before 2:00, so we found a shady spot and just hung around for a while.

I'd known about Iron Gwazi since before the pandemic, although it hadn't opened at that time. I was really excited to ride it because it was the only coaster that supposedly could rival Steel Vengeance. Over time more and more coasters were added to the Orlando area that needed to go on my list, but Tampa Bay was really the origin point for this story. Although it was a one-hour drive from Orlando, and it was really hot, those were also things that I knew going in. What I didn't know was just how beautiful the park is, and how good the theming, the environment, and the non-ride elements are. This is just a really fantastic park and it left me with a very good impression and a good feeling for my first full day of the trip. That might have something to do with the company. For the first couple of hours I was joined by Gary and Carl from the Buzzed Bars. Carl is a local and Gary had been here once or twice before, so they knew what to do right at the opening. Which was pretty much in line with what I've been told and what I planned, but it's nice to have a local guide. They could only stay a couple of hours because they had a baseball game to get to, but I really enjoyed the time that they were there and that set the tone for the rest of the day. Iron Gwazi Iron Gwazi was my main attraction for this trip and the ride that I was most interested in getting on. The same was true for Carl and Gary, so we met up there almost immediately after opening and before the ride was even running. Carl was looking forward to seeing other riders experience it for the first time. Unfortunately Gary had gotten some evening rides with friends the night before, but it was brand-new to me, so Carl still managed to get his wish. Personally, I didn't know if it was going to live up to the hype. I knew it was supposed to be as good if not better than Steel Vengeance, but I really like Steel Vengeance. I'd heard about some of the elements, including the famous Death Roll, but I didn't really know what those entailed. The line was nice and short right at opening, which is always a good start. Like a lot of the queues at SeaWorld Parks, this one was great: not a lot of switchbacks and fantastic decorations. We were early enough that we were able to get a back-row seat with no problem. Carl and I sat in the back, with Gary just in front of us. Carl was really psyched to be in the back row. And then it started. The first drop is beyond 90\u00b0, which I didn't think would make a ton of difference, but with the length of this train there was a noticeable yank over the top. Unlike a lot of other RMC coasters, which are built on old coasters with an oval layout, Gwazi's is more square, so there's more diving under beams and interacting with other elements of the ride in a way that's not possible with an oval like Steel vengeance. As a result I really didn't know which element was going to come where, which is an interesting way to ride. The infamous Death Roll happens about a third of the way through the ride, which isn't something I really anticipated. It's a zero-g roll, and I've done zero g-rolls before and like them, but this was unbelievable. It points almost straight down, and with the amount of speed that you have going into it, especially when you're in the back, you just get yanked all the way through it. There is a wave turn or a wall stall, which I\u2019ve also seen before. What I didn't anticipate was the speed with which you will take all these elements. The thing was going so fast, even early in the morning, that it just seemed like every maneuver was yanking you one way or the other. Gary had said that it reminded him of Intimidator 305 in the way that the transitions were so sharp, and I agree with him. The overall feel is that the number of elements are squeezed into a space that's slightly too small for them, so instead of having a little breathing space between, you just go right from one element to the next, kind of like the Batman: the Ride. It did leave me with the \u201cwhat just happened?\u201d feeling when we hit the brakes hard, which is always a great sensation on a roller coaster. I came off of it stunned and impressed, but I don't know if I'm ready to call it my new number one. Cheetah Hunt Cheetah Hunt is close by Gwazi, it's family-friendly, and has a reputation for breaking down, so we did that next, since it seemed to be running and we didn't have a ton of line first thing in the morning. As with most of the rides at this park, the queue was excellent and mostly indoors. I thought we were going to have almost no line at all, but there's a very large station platform and that's where we found the crowd. I don't think we waited more than 20 minutes in total, which was fine. We got back-row seats for this one as well, which was great, but it's a launch coaster so that doesn't matter all that much. The thing I appreciate about Cheetah Hunt is that the track itself, the shape of the coaster, fits the theme. It's trying to be a cheetah simulator, if that's a thing. The magnetic launches, of which there are three, simulate a cheetah's bursts of speed. The tree section, which a lot of people complain about, to me represents a cheetah climbing a tree and pacing around in circles having a good look around. As a coaster, you climb almost straight up that tree and there's a nice little pop of air as you do it. You get a good view while you're up there, which is intended, and then it drops almost straight back down and into a launch section which I think is great. There are some sections over water which I understand didn't always have water in them, so that was good to see. The ride runs straight out over a plains section, which is again appropriate. There are some s-curves in kind of a concrete ditch, which again is a cheetah kind of move. I don't know if cheetahs are known for zero-g rolls, but there's one in there which is gentle and not too forceful. On the whole I really liked it. It was a lot of fun. It's not the most intense ride, which made it a great choice right after Gwazi. It straddles the line between family coaster and thrill coaster so it's something that most people can ride, which I think is fantastic. It makes great use of the tunnels. And the train cars are fantastic. The front car with the cheetah\u2019s face on it looks amazing, and the trains have those really upright seats that Intamin is known for. This one is just fun, and I really like it. Montu After Gwazi, Montu was the primary thing I wanted to ride, and Gary thought so too, so we went right over there. Fortunately we were still early enough that there was basically no line at all. Gary chose a middle seat and Carl and I took the back row. I normally like the front row the first time I ride an inverted coaster, but that row was occupied at that moment, and since it was a walk-on, I didn't want the other guys to have to wait through an additional cycle. I\u2019m very glad in retrospect that I ended up in the back. I have ridden a lot of B&M inverted coasters, most of the ones in the US. In fact, Batman was my first B&M coaster way back in the 90s, so I have a pretty good history with this kind of ride. I have my favorites and those that I think are statistically the best, and those two lists aren't the same. I'd heard for several years that Montu was the best invert, hands down. Much like Gwazi, I wasn't sure if I wanted to believe that. After just that one ride, I am a believer: Montu is the best. The ride makes excellent use of tunnels and ditches carved below the surface. Inversions that go into and through tunnels are just not things that I expected, and the sensation of speed is unbelievable. But the speed isn't just an illusion, it's actually there. This is probably one of the fastest inverts that I've been on, I think because it stays so low to the ground. I have to mention the bat-wing element, which is often cited as the highlight of this ride. It's definitely a lot smoother than the cobra rolls that I've done on other inverted coasters. Afterburn also has a bat-wing but it's not quite as intense as this one. And with the way this one goes under the ground, it's just the perfect element for the show piece of this ride. But the thing that really got me was the zero-g roll that happens just before the end of the ride. It just pops up from out of the ground, flips you over violently, and then dives back underground again. It's not something that I was expecting, and it gave that feeling that I associated with my very first rides on Batman. After that, Carl and Gary had to leave to make it to their baseball game. The only other coaster in that section of the park is Cobra's Curse, which is family-friendly and also attracts a line. Carl and Gary recommended that if the line was in fact short, I should get in that right away and not miss out. It was great to do a few rides with other club members. Even if it was only for a little while, it definitely enhanced my enjoyment, especially on Gwazi and Montu. So I parted ways with them in front of Cobra's Curse and got in line. Cobra's Curse The line for Cobra's curse unfortunately was not 5 minutes as advertised, more like 20 or 25. Fortunately what it is, is indoors. I don't know if it was fully air conditioned, but it was certainly cool enough in there that it was comfortable, which I appreciated. This is another ride that's more fun than it really ought to be. It has an awful lot of unusual features that add up to a really fun ride. For starters it has an elevator lift rather than a traditional lift hill. Trains are only two cars long, two rows each, so an elevator lift makes sense, but it's still very strange. And when you come out of the elevator you're faced with this gigantic Cobra statue right in front of you. Or right in front of me, because I was in the front row. It doesn't do anything; it's just right there. And strangely the track does this slight outer bank when it makes a 90\u00b0 turn in front of this cobra. It's hard to remember what the first part of the ride is like, but it's not bad. After a bit the train comes to a complete stop and the cars rotate in place 180\u00b0. So the next bit takes place backwards. After a bit of that, the cars start to spin. It's not a fast spin like Gerstlauer spinners; it's more of a controlled spin, similar to Time Traveler. Now that I've ridden a few coasters with that concept, I was able to enjoy things like facing the outside of a banked turn as you're going through it. This ride also makes good use of trenches below ground level. I don't know if those are necessary but they do add something to it. Those aren't the only rides at this park that use trenches. Maybe the park owners just like digging? I'm not really sure. Montu again After Cobra's Curse I went back to try Montu again, this time from the front row. Oddly I don't think the experience was enhanced by sitting in the front. That's normally the case for inverted coasters, because it's fun to be able to see what you're doing. However Montu spends so much time down in trenches that it actually didn't make much difference when you could see. And of course sitting in the front means you have forces that kick in at different times during each inversion, which is always a little bit weird. Unusually, I think this is a back-row ride. It's still really good, but I don't think a second ride in the front added anything to the experience. Lunch At this point I'd done the coasters that are close to the front of the park. These are the ones that people gravitate towards first, and therefore get the longest lines. We'd been doing pretty well with the crowd, and nothing had a very long line. However I knew that it was getting close to lunchtime and I was starting to get hungry, so I decided that I should move towards the back of the park and find something to eat back there. It turns out that Busch Gardens Tampa has a big dining hall with live entertainment, similar to Williamsburg or Carowinds. So that proved to be a pretty nice place to eat. I got a chicken sandwich, nothing terribly fancy, and took a break inside in the air conditioning. Scorpion Scorpion is situated right outside the dining hall, so I figured that would be a good choice right after lunch. It's an old Schwarzkopf, which means that it's not particularly fancy or tall, but it does have track that goes through its vertical loop, so that's cool? I don't have much of the same fondness for Schwarzkopf that a lot of other enthusiasts have, especially these smaller portable models. Even though this ride has been there since the park opened, it's still just sitting on a plot of dirt, which seemed odd to me. Maybe they've moved it recently; I'm not really sure. So I got on not expecting very much; I got a seat in the back row, which was nice. My ride was a little more janky than I'm entirely comfortable with, even from a Schwarzkopf. The loop was a little bit too intense, and some of the turns were a little bit more forceful than I would have liked. I was also put off by the fact that two riders in front of me, moms with young children might I add, both had their phones out and were actively recording at arm's length during the ride. That really disappointed me and I thought they should have set a better example. Fortunately nobody lost a phone and so nobody got hurt, so I guess that's fine, but I don't like the behavior. So I think Scorpion has to be my least favorite ride here, by default. Kumba Kumba is a classic B&M coaster, one of the highlights of this park. It's been here a very long time, it's photogenic, and lately there's been rumors that it's going to be taken out because it's too old. So while I didn't have the highest expectations, I was looking forward to riding it, and I really wanted to get it on my credit list. I haven't really done a whole lot of B&M looping coasters, ones with floors anyway. I was mostly just expecting a floorless coaster, but with a floor, and that's pretty much what I got. The over-the-shoulder restraints are the original version, which are hard plastic and that's not great. I got the back row, and I tried riding defensively, but I did get a little bit beat up on some of the inversions. I had a very hard time keeping track of where I was in the layout; that\u2019s not real surprising given that it was my first time riding it. But I might have liked to have a better idea of exactly what was going on. I do distinctly remember the double corkscrew, but that may have been because I stood and watched it from the bridge before I got on the ride. This was another one of those instances where I saw the spot where everybody takes the picture from, and it wasn't anything like I thought it was going to be in relation to the rest of the ride. I could have gone back for another lap, but I chose not to mostly because I felt like it did beat me up just a little bit. And I wasn't sure if riding from the front would make much difference. On another day I might have gone for a second ride. SheiKra This one is a dive coaster, which is a type of coaster I don't generally care for all that much. With the B&M dive coasters, some are distinctly better than others. This one is one of the older models, and it's fairly similar to its cousin Griffon at Busch Gardens Williamsburg, although a lot of people think this one is better than most. I don't remember the line being particularly long, but that was true of most things on this day. I know I was on the outside edge, probably row 3. I'm not sure why I always get the outside edge on dive coasters; it just seems to happen. This coaster has the old style B&M restraints, meaning they're hard plastic rather than the soft vests. My ears aren't very fond of the plastic restraints, but I have to admit that it does make a difference to the ride experience. I definitely got a feeling of air time on the drop which is what I wanted. The drop was pretty good, not fantastic, but I always think that dive coasters should actually drop into something, which most ones in the United States don't. Oddly this coaster drops into a ruined tower on its second drop after the midcourse, not the first drop, which is strange. The elements seemed fine; nothing particularly special. The splashdown in this case didn't really do it for me the way the one in Williamsburg did. So I wasn't blown away by this one but I wasn't unimpressed either. Tigris And that left Tigris as the last coaster I needed to ride here at the park. Tigris is a Skyrocket II model, which has long been the source of an inside joke for me. Is it still an inside joke if I'm the only one who ever acknowledges it or finds it funny? Anyway I had never ridden a Skyrocket II, although I had ridden the Skyrocket I and Skyrocket III, of which there are only one each in the world. I had a couple of chances to ride a Skyrocket II in the past, but it never worked out. So I decided to officially end the joke today and ride a Skyrocket II. I didn't particularly care where I sat in the train because it goes back and forth, so it doesn't really matter. I'm no great fan of the comfort collars that a lot of these coasters have, but then again I don't think anybody is. They don't really cut into my neck as such and they don't seem to interfere that much with the airtime, but they aren't great. This ride starts with a triple launch forward, back, and then forward again which was a little bit more intense than I had envisioned. I'm not really sure why because I know how the thing works. I think that the second backward launch lifted the train up higher than I really expected and it started to curve around the top of the loop. But then the third launch did pretty much what I expected it to, and got us up to the top of the loop, about 150 feet. I knew that there's a heartline roll at the top of the loop and I also knew it was slow so I was expecting it. It really was as slow as I anticipated, and I could definitely feel the pull of gravity as we went through it. Not my favorite sensation, but it wasn't terrible, and it dives down almost immediately after that so no big deal. On the whole, not my favorite, but not really bad either. Interestingly, the ride shut down immediately after I got off. I don't know if I did something to break it but there it is. That's fine, because I didn't really want to ride it again. Iron Gwazi again After Tigris I spent some time walking around and shopping. I was actually really impressed with the quality of the merchandise, especially the tiger themed merchandise. I didn't buy anything right away because I knew I had some time left and I thought that I would spend it riding Iron Gwazi some more. So I went back down to that part of the park, which wasn\u2019t terribly difficult, but it was the hottest part of the day at this point. The line for Gwazi hadn't really gotten any longer, in fact I think it may have been shorter than when we rode it in the morning. So I got back in line, got to the station pretty quickly, and asked for a front row-ride. I was granted my request, and joined by somebody who was filming with a GoPro for his YouTube channel. The first thing that surprised me was just how long we hung off the top of the first lift. I know, because of physics, that the beginning of the train is always going to hang over the drop a bit, but for some reason this one really seemed to hang for an extraordinary amount of time. And because it's slightly past vertical, it did feel like it was more than the usual drop. Then the drop did happen, and I pretty much stopped thinking. The ride was exactly the same as the morning ride, but about 10% faster. I know coasters warm up during the day; that's not a new phenomenon. However I didn't expect Gwazi to get that much faster, mostly because I thought it was out of control in the morning, so I didn't really see how it could get faster. Nevertheless this was definitely faster, and I got hurled through the death roll and the wall stall and everything else, and it was all breakneck speed. So that was alarming, to say the least. And because I'm stupid, I got right back on again. I figured this would probably be my last time, so I thought I'd go with whatever seat they assigned me. They gave me the back row again. If anything it was even faster, more reckless, and more out of control in the back. When we got to the brake run, I found that I was having trouble catching my breath. Some of that could have been the weather, or dehydration, but I really think part of it was that the ride took my breath away. It's just that intense. I think it's safe to say it's more intense than Steel Vengeance. What I'm not completely certain about is whether I like that better or not. It doesn't seem to have any space to breathe, like Steel Vengeance does. Which is a pretty funny thing to say about Steel Vengeance, but I believe it now. I don't know when I'll ride Gwazi again so I'll have to give it some thought and see where it lands in my rankings.","title":"Busch Gardens Tampa"},{"location":"coasters/2023/buschgardenstampa/#busch-gardens-tampa","text":"Visited: September 10, 2023 Attending: Brian, Gary, Carl In a lot of ways Busch Gardens Tampa was my primary motivator for this trip. I'd known about Iron Gwazi since before the pandemic, although it hadn't opened at that time. I was really excited to ride it because it was the only coaster that supposedly could rival Steel Vengeance. Over time more and more coasters were added to the Orlando area that needed to go on my list, but Tampa Bay was really the origin point for this story. Although it was a one-hour drive from Orlando, and it was really hot, those were also things that I knew going in. What I didn't know was just how beautiful the park is, and how good the theming, the environment, and the non-ride elements are. This is just a really fantastic park and it left me with a very good impression and a good feeling for my first full day of the trip. That might have something to do with the company. For the first couple of hours I was joined by Gary and Carl from the Buzzed Bars. Carl is a local and Gary had been here once or twice before, so they knew what to do right at the opening. Which was pretty much in line with what I've been told and what I planned, but it's nice to have a local guide. They could only stay a couple of hours because they had a baseball game to get to, but I really enjoyed the time that they were there and that set the tone for the rest of the day.","title":"Busch Gardens Tampa"},{"location":"coasters/2023/buschgardenstampa/#iron-gwazi","text":"Iron Gwazi was my main attraction for this trip and the ride that I was most interested in getting on. The same was true for Carl and Gary, so we met up there almost immediately after opening and before the ride was even running. Carl was looking forward to seeing other riders experience it for the first time. Unfortunately Gary had gotten some evening rides with friends the night before, but it was brand-new to me, so Carl still managed to get his wish. Personally, I didn't know if it was going to live up to the hype. I knew it was supposed to be as good if not better than Steel Vengeance, but I really like Steel Vengeance. I'd heard about some of the elements, including the famous Death Roll, but I didn't really know what those entailed. The line was nice and short right at opening, which is always a good start. Like a lot of the queues at SeaWorld Parks, this one was great: not a lot of switchbacks and fantastic decorations. We were early enough that we were able to get a back-row seat with no problem. Carl and I sat in the back, with Gary just in front of us. Carl was really psyched to be in the back row. And then it started. The first drop is beyond 90\u00b0, which I didn't think would make a ton of difference, but with the length of this train there was a noticeable yank over the top. Unlike a lot of other RMC coasters, which are built on old coasters with an oval layout, Gwazi's is more square, so there's more diving under beams and interacting with other elements of the ride in a way that's not possible with an oval like Steel vengeance. As a result I really didn't know which element was going to come where, which is an interesting way to ride. The infamous Death Roll happens about a third of the way through the ride, which isn't something I really anticipated. It's a zero-g roll, and I've done zero g-rolls before and like them, but this was unbelievable. It points almost straight down, and with the amount of speed that you have going into it, especially when you're in the back, you just get yanked all the way through it. There is a wave turn or a wall stall, which I\u2019ve also seen before. What I didn't anticipate was the speed with which you will take all these elements. The thing was going so fast, even early in the morning, that it just seemed like every maneuver was yanking you one way or the other. Gary had said that it reminded him of Intimidator 305 in the way that the transitions were so sharp, and I agree with him. The overall feel is that the number of elements are squeezed into a space that's slightly too small for them, so instead of having a little breathing space between, you just go right from one element to the next, kind of like the Batman: the Ride. It did leave me with the \u201cwhat just happened?\u201d feeling when we hit the brakes hard, which is always a great sensation on a roller coaster. I came off of it stunned and impressed, but I don't know if I'm ready to call it my new number one.","title":"Iron Gwazi"},{"location":"coasters/2023/buschgardenstampa/#cheetah-hunt","text":"Cheetah Hunt is close by Gwazi, it's family-friendly, and has a reputation for breaking down, so we did that next, since it seemed to be running and we didn't have a ton of line first thing in the morning. As with most of the rides at this park, the queue was excellent and mostly indoors. I thought we were going to have almost no line at all, but there's a very large station platform and that's where we found the crowd. I don't think we waited more than 20 minutes in total, which was fine. We got back-row seats for this one as well, which was great, but it's a launch coaster so that doesn't matter all that much. The thing I appreciate about Cheetah Hunt is that the track itself, the shape of the coaster, fits the theme. It's trying to be a cheetah simulator, if that's a thing. The magnetic launches, of which there are three, simulate a cheetah's bursts of speed. The tree section, which a lot of people complain about, to me represents a cheetah climbing a tree and pacing around in circles having a good look around. As a coaster, you climb almost straight up that tree and there's a nice little pop of air as you do it. You get a good view while you're up there, which is intended, and then it drops almost straight back down and into a launch section which I think is great. There are some sections over water which I understand didn't always have water in them, so that was good to see. The ride runs straight out over a plains section, which is again appropriate. There are some s-curves in kind of a concrete ditch, which again is a cheetah kind of move. I don't know if cheetahs are known for zero-g rolls, but there's one in there which is gentle and not too forceful. On the whole I really liked it. It was a lot of fun. It's not the most intense ride, which made it a great choice right after Gwazi. It straddles the line between family coaster and thrill coaster so it's something that most people can ride, which I think is fantastic. It makes great use of the tunnels. And the train cars are fantastic. The front car with the cheetah\u2019s face on it looks amazing, and the trains have those really upright seats that Intamin is known for. This one is just fun, and I really like it.","title":"Cheetah Hunt"},{"location":"coasters/2023/buschgardenstampa/#montu","text":"After Gwazi, Montu was the primary thing I wanted to ride, and Gary thought so too, so we went right over there. Fortunately we were still early enough that there was basically no line at all. Gary chose a middle seat and Carl and I took the back row. I normally like the front row the first time I ride an inverted coaster, but that row was occupied at that moment, and since it was a walk-on, I didn't want the other guys to have to wait through an additional cycle. I\u2019m very glad in retrospect that I ended up in the back. I have ridden a lot of B&M inverted coasters, most of the ones in the US. In fact, Batman was my first B&M coaster way back in the 90s, so I have a pretty good history with this kind of ride. I have my favorites and those that I think are statistically the best, and those two lists aren't the same. I'd heard for several years that Montu was the best invert, hands down. Much like Gwazi, I wasn't sure if I wanted to believe that. After just that one ride, I am a believer: Montu is the best. The ride makes excellent use of tunnels and ditches carved below the surface. Inversions that go into and through tunnels are just not things that I expected, and the sensation of speed is unbelievable. But the speed isn't just an illusion, it's actually there. This is probably one of the fastest inverts that I've been on, I think because it stays so low to the ground. I have to mention the bat-wing element, which is often cited as the highlight of this ride. It's definitely a lot smoother than the cobra rolls that I've done on other inverted coasters. Afterburn also has a bat-wing but it's not quite as intense as this one. And with the way this one goes under the ground, it's just the perfect element for the show piece of this ride.

So I went back down to that part of the park, which wasn\u2019t terribly difficult, but it was the hottest part of the day at this point. The line for Gwazi hadn't really gotten any longer, in fact I think it may have been shorter than when we rode it in the morning. So I got back in line, got to the station pretty quickly, and asked for a front row-ride. I was granted my request, and joined by somebody who was filming with a GoPro for his YouTube channel. The first thing that surprised me was just how long we hung off the top of the first lift. I know, because of physics, that the beginning of the train is always going to hang over the drop a bit, but for some reason this one really seemed to hang for an extraordinary amount of time. And because it's slightly past vertical, it did feel like it was more than the usual drop. Then the drop did happen, and I pretty much stopped thinking. The ride was exactly the same as the morning ride, but about 10% faster. I know coasters warm up during the day; that's not a new phenomenon. However I didn't expect Gwazi to get that much faster, mostly because I thought it was out of control in the morning, so I didn't really see how it could get faster. Nevertheless this was definitely faster, and I got hurled through the death roll and the wall stall and everything else, and it was all breakneck speed. So that was alarming, to say the least. And because I'm stupid, I got right back on again. I figured this would probably be my last time, so I thought I'd go with whatever seat they assigned me. They gave me the back row again. If anything it was even faster, more reckless, and more out of control in the back. When we got to the brake run, I found that I was having trouble catching my breath. Some of that could have been the weather, or dehydration, but I really think part of it was that the ride took my breath away. It's just that intense. I think it's safe to say it's more intense than Steel Vengeance. What I'm not completely certain about is whether I like that better or not. It doesn't seem to have any space to breathe, like Steel Vengeance does. Which is a pretty funny thing to say about Steel Vengeance, but I believe it now. I don't know when I'll ride Gwazi again so I'll have to give it some thought and see where it lands in my rankings.","title":"Iron Gwazi again"},{"location":"coasters/2023/canadaswonderland/","text":"Canada\u2019s Wonderland Visited: July 29, 2023 Attending: Brian and a bunch of Buzzed Bars: Marcus, Zoe (Marcus\u2019 daughter), Tom, Kelli, Marc, Meg, Allison, Mullet, Joey, Bryant, Tyler When I was first considering my plan for the post-conference, I thought I might go by Kings Island and see if Allison and Mullet were around to join me. As it happens, they\u2019d decided to join a group heading to Canada\u2019s Wonderland that day. Since that was my Plan B anyway, I asked to be included. Wonderland is interesting because it seems like a top-tier Cedar Fair park in some ways. It has a large number of coasters, some of which are impressive new additions. It\u2019s also got an impressive Main Street modeled after Kings Island and Kings Dominion, but instead of an Eiffel Tower, it has a giant fake mountain instead. Although it\u2019s a large park, it\u2019s still doable in one day. It\u2019s probably not much bigger than Carowinds. It also becomes quickly clear that the large coaster count is partially the result of a monumental amount of trash coasters with small footprints. It makes cred-running a challenge, but on subsequent visits, you can skip the garbage. That\u2019s what Marcus mostly did, although many of us were cred-running. I wasn\u2019t staying with the rest of the group, so I arrived a bit before opening. Unfortunately, it was pouring rain at that time, to the point where I didn\u2019t want to venture into the park. I sheltered in the gift shop for an hour while I waited for the others to arrive. Then we just went out into the rain, because we\u2019re enthusiasts. Most of the coasters were running, and the rain did lessen throughout the morning. By late afternoon, it was sunny and pleasant, which unfortunately brought out the crowds. The promised mugginess never appeared, so I spent most of the day being a bit cold and damp. Wonder Mountain\u2019s Guardian This only barely qualifies as a coaster. I\u2019m not entirely sure how to feel about it myself. It has a lift hill, then a little drop, then a turn, and then suddenly you\u2019re riding a shooting dark ride with screens and stuff. But that doesn\u2019t last very long either, because the track takes you into a round room, there\u2019s a bit more shooting, and then surprise! It\u2019s a drop track. And then you\u2019re done. I didn\u2019t know much about the coaster going in, except vague memories of a dark-ride portion, but Marc gave me a hint as we sat down, so I was pretty sure there was a drop track and where it would be. Which I think was a good thing on the whole. I did terribly at the shooty game, and other than that, there wasn\u2019t much to say. We primarily did this one first because the queue and half the ride are indoors. Bat Canada\u2019s Wonderland has a number of coasters with names that I find perplexing, although I\u2019m the only one who seems to find them so. The Bat is a Vekoma Boomerang, just a standard model, with nothing bat-like about it. We went over there next to get it out of the way while it was still raining, because Boomerangs tend to have long queues. Marc and I were at the back of the group, so we got separated from our full-train takeover. As a result, that meant we were in the front car on the next run. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever done the front car of a boomerang before, although I\u2019ve done the back. Which is more or less the same thing, just at different points in the ride. The train is so long that at either end, the forces get strange: you get a sudden burst of acceleration when you\u2019re at the bottom of the vertical loop, for example. Other than that, it\u2019s just a boomerang, although the setting is maybe a little nicer than most. At this point, the group went over to Leviathan, which is admittedly the biggest draw in the park. However, it was still raining too hard for me to be comfortable riding at giga-coaster speeds, so I decided to sit out until later. According to several group members, I made the right call. Dragon Fyre Dragon Fyre has nothing to do with Drachen Fire, except that they\u2019re both Arrows. This is one of the typical old Arrow loopers found at many parks around the country. This model has two vertical loops back-to-back, and then the standard double corkscrew. It\u2019s only 78 feet tall, and the layout is a simple oval, mostly. There\u2019s no theming of any kind, and it sits in a grass field by the parking lot; it\u2019s fairly unimaginative as Arrow loopers go. It\u2019s also terrible. I didn\u2019t really care about my position in the train because this model can be unkind, and it still managed to beat me up. The loops were crushing, the turnaround was janky, the corkscrews were worse, and there\u2019s a completely pointless mid-course brake run before a very rough helix and the final brakes. I know Arrows can be janky, but this was unusually bad. I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s worse than Anaconda, my previous record-holder for terrible Arrows. I knew there was some garbage at this park, but I didn\u2019t expect this to be one. Then we took a lunch break. The food hall was quite pleasant and well decorated. Most importantly, it was indoors and warm. So that was a good thing. After that, we kind of split off to do different things. Vortex Vortex, again, is no relation to any other Cedar Fair coasters named Vortex. In fact, it\u2019s an Arrow suspended coaster, some of which have been named \u201cBat,\u201d but whatever. I had no idea there were any suspended models remaining, outside of the three in the US. I\u2019ve ridden those three, and found them anywhere from \u201cdull\u201d to \u201ckinda good,\u201d so I wasn\u2019t prepared for this one. I took a back row seat for the heck of it, which may have made a difference. The lift ascends the fake mountain in the center of the park, turns, and then drops off of it. That was my first surprise, because I got a pop of airtime, which I didn\u2019t even think was possible on this model. What follows is the standard swoops and dives of a suspended coaster, but much more forceful than I\u2019d experienced before. On every turn, all the cars were swinging straight out to 90 degrees, and I think would have gone further if the design would have allowed it. It\u2019s so fast that it\u2019s over almost before you know it. The final brake is like hitting a wall, and there\u2019s still so much lateral force that our car swung to its maximum on the brake run. It\u2019s frankly astonishing, and makes you wonder if the other versions could run like this. It was definitely the biggest surprise of the trip for most of us, and possibly the best coaster in the park after the three B&Ms. Wilde Beast This is a wooden coaster near Leviathan, so we did that just because it was nearby. It\u2019s a late-era PTC, one of two that opened with the park. It\u2019s apparently a copy of the Wildcat coaster that used to be at Coney Island, but I don\u2019t know anything about that. It\u2019s apparently also the same layout as Grizzly at Kings Dominion, but without the forest. It\u2019s fine, I guess. I don\u2019t remember much specifically about it. Flight Deck This coaster is a Vekoma Suspended Looping Coaster (SLC), a type that\u2019s famously rough and generally disliked by enthusiasts. I\u2019d just ridden one the day before, and it wasn\u2019t too bad, so I had hope for this iteration. Oh, I was wrong about that. Somehow, the restraints on this one were more restrictive than those on Thunderhawk, even scraping my ears as I lowered them. I don\u2019t know why that is, but I was unable to escape the headbanging. So most of the ride was spent in a defensive hunch, trying to keep my head safe. Worst of all, after the brake run, the train makes a right turn into the station, which was sharp enough to deliver one last whack, even when I thought I was safe. I\u2019ve only ridden a few of these, but this is by far my least favorite. Time Warp Time Warp was the coaster I was most curious about for this trip. It\u2019s a Zamperla Volare, a \u201cflying\u201d coaster, but one with an absolutely terrible reputation. You enter by climbing a ladder into the car, putting your head between two pads, and grabbing some handles. Then a cage closes over your back (but you can\u2019t feel it at all), and the car raises into a flying-ish position. It has a spiral lift hill, which is interesting, and space-saving. The very first drop is head-first, and does create a bit of flying sensation, but it\u2019s much too brief for enjoyment. The subsequent turns are too tight, and the inversions are just strange. They\u2019re far too slow to have any centrifugal force, so you\u2019re forced to hang on to the handles and brace as you go through. There\u2019s a padded chin-rest, but my shoulders and neck are strong enough that I was able to stay off it the whole time, which I think helped. In fact, the ladder becomes a foot-brace while you\u2019re riding, so between that and the handles, I was able to stay \u201cplanked\u201d for most of the ride. Still, one shouldn\u2019t have to brace that hard on a roller coaster. I found it to be not as bad as I feared, not at all the worst in the park. Some of my colleagues didn\u2019t agree, though. Behemoth Poor Behemoth suffers the same fate as Intimidator at Carowinds: It\u2019s a decent B&M hyper in the same park as a giga, so it gets overlooked. Also like Intimidator, it\u2019s a straight out-and-back, without any of the turns that Nitro or Goliath have. So the first couple of camelbacks rewarded us with very nice floater airtime, which made me happy. The hammerhead turnaround is the tightest I\u2019ve ever seen, and carried some strong positive g\u2019s. The way back should have been more magnificent camelbacks, but the first one had a trim that sucked all the speed out. As a result, for several hills in a row, there was no air at all. After the mid-course and a forceful helix, there are some bunny hills that regained the air, but that bit in the middle left a sour taste in my mouth. I\u2019d like to give it another try without the trims hitting so hard, because I think I could really like this one. Backlot Stunt Coaster We continued with our cred-running with Backlot Stunt Coaster, which is identical to the coasters of the same name at Kings Island and Kings Dominion, both of which we\u2019d all ridden. Unlike the Kings Island version, the special effects were turned off, so there were no references to The Italian Job other than the layout itself. With the effects, it\u2019s a pretty good coaster. Without them, well, the launch and the initial helix are pretty good, and the rest is just meh. As always happens, we waited far too long for this. Mighty Canadian Minebuster None of us were looking forward to this. It\u2019s a wooden coaster that opened with the park, like Wilde Beast, but for some reason, this one has aged very poorly. Joey and I made the mistake of riding on a wheel seat, which we\u2019d been warned about, but I honestly forgot. As a result, I ended up with one of the most painful coaster experiences I\u2019ve ever had. The hammering started with the first drop, and never let up, just banging all the way through. I felt a headache develop halfway through, and from that point I was just hoping it would end. Maybe it\u2019s my fault for grabbing the wrong seat, but this was by far the most unpleasant coaster in the park for me, if not in my entire life. I\u2019d really rather avoid this in the future. Yukon Striker This is the newest coaster in the park, a very tall B&M dive model. I\u2019ve ridden a few of these, and never been too impressed by them; they\u2019re basically one-trick ponies. This one, though, did the one trick better than I\u2019ve experienced. It\u2019s one of the few models with a true vertical drop, and I could really feel it. Even from the back row, there was a definite sense of freefall, rather than riding on rails. I could feel when the wheels re-engaged, or so I thought. The tunnel was a nice addition, as I think all dive coasters should go underground, but few do. The subsequent elements were pretty good as well, better than the standard dive loop / zero-g roll combo that most of them have. It had a good turn of speed at this time of day too. On the whole, it was more enjoyable than I expected for a dive coaster, and I\u2019m glad I waited for it. Leviathan At this point, there wasn\u2019t much left to ride, except for some kiddie coasters and a wild mouse, all of which I skipped. However, I still hadn\u2019t gotten my ride on Leviathan, and I was getting antsy about it. The rain had stopped, and the sky was looking gorgeous, so the lines were increasing in length, which was bad. However, the crew joined me for this one, as none of us need much incentive to ride a giga. The line was about half an hour, and unfortunately the grouper put us in the middle and didn\u2019t want to be persuaded otherwise. It\u2019s not a straight out-and-back, because there\u2019s no room for that. Instead, it\u2019s got really tall banked turns, much like Fury does. There are still several big camelbacks, all of which provide good air, but not much suggesting low-to-the-ground speed. And sadly, it\u2019s too short. You think you\u2019re hitting a mid-course, and then it\u2019s over. I knew it wouldn\u2019t be better than Fury, but it somehow feels like Fury in a way that Orion doesn\u2019t. Something about Orion\u2019s layout makes it feel like a tall hyper instead of a giga. Leviathan is obviously the prototype that led to Fury; it\u2019s written all over the layout and the experience. I\u2019d absolutely ride it again, and it\u2019s certainly the best ride in the park. Unfortunately, the line for Leviathan discouraged further riding. Even though it was only around 7pm at this point, the sun wasn\u2019t even close to setting, this far north. And most of us planned to do something on Sunday, so we all left around this point. The final verdict: there\u2019s a lot of junk in this park. Leviathan and Behemoth are the stars, pretty much what I expected, Yukon Striker was a pleasant surprise, and Vortex was completely out of left field. The rest of it, I\u2019d be happy to never ride again. Getting RMC to work their magic on Minebuster would be a huge boost to the park; it\u2019s not like they don\u2019t have another old woodie to spare. It\u2019ll probably be hard for me to get back up here again, but I wouldn\u2019t say no.","title":"Canada's Wonderland"},{"location":"coasters/2023/canadaswonderland/#wonder-mountains-guardian","text":"This only barely qualifies as a coaster.

There are still several big camelbacks, all of which provide good air, but not much suggesting low-to-the-ground speed. And sadly, it\u2019s too short. You think you\u2019re hitting a mid-course, and then it\u2019s over. I knew it wouldn\u2019t be better than Fury, but it somehow feels like Fury in a way that Orion doesn\u2019t. Something about Orion\u2019s layout makes it feel like a tall hyper instead of a giga. Leviathan is obviously the prototype that led to Fury; it\u2019s written all over the layout and the experience. I\u2019d absolutely ride it again, and it\u2019s certainly the best ride in the park. Unfortunately, the line for Leviathan discouraged further riding. Even though it was only around 7pm at this point, the sun wasn\u2019t even close to setting, this far north. And most of us planned to do something on Sunday, so we all left around this point. The final verdict: there\u2019s a lot of junk in this park. Leviathan and Behemoth are the stars, pretty much what I expected, Yukon Striker was a pleasant surprise, and Vortex was completely out of left field. The rest of it, I\u2019d be happy to never ride again. Getting RMC to work their magic on Minebuster would be a huge boost to the park; it\u2019s not like they don\u2019t have another old woodie to spare. It\u2019ll probably be hard for me to get back up here again, but I wouldn\u2019t say no.","title":"Leviathan"},{"location":"coasters/2023/dorney/","text":"Dorney Park Visited: September 22, 2023 Attending: Brian, Buzzed Bars This event was an informal pre-game for the Sooper Dooper Stumble event. It sort of surprised me; I thought that everyone would prefer to go to Great Adventure, and some people did that. But most people wanted to go do Dorney, either because they hadn\u2019t been before, or because they wanted a smaller park with the limited time a Friday evening would provide. The park was hosting a Haunt event, which isn\u2019t my favorite park activity, but it wasn\u2019t hard to avoid. Demon Drop Let\u2019s get this out of the way first: Demon Drop is not a credit. It\u2019s the only remaining first-generation Intamin drop tower left in the US. However, it runs on tracks, is powered by gravity, and forms a complete circuit, so there\u2019s an argument that it\u2019s a credit. However, the manufacturer and parks never called it anything but a drop tower, so I\u2019m sticking with that. Anyway, I rode Freefall at Great Adventure back in the 90s, and I never rode one of these again, until now. Knowing that it\u2019s the last one, I wanted to have this experience. Fortunately, so did the rest of the group, so a bunch of us went there first. It\u2019s almost exactly how I remembered it, although it doesn\u2019t seem nearly so tall anymore. The drop really feels like a straight drop, where it\u2019s nothing but you and a giant steel box plummeting straight down. I don\u2019t know why other drop towers don\u2019t feel quite like that, but there you are. Of course, the feeling only lasts a few seconds, and then you\u2019re lying on your back. I\u2019m glad to have done one again, but I\u2019m not converted into a drop tower fan. Thunderhawk In keeping with proper Dorney practice, we headed toward the bottom of the park, leaving the top to the crowds (which were very light at that moment). Some of us had bought fast-passes; others (myself included) did not. Thunderhawk ended up being next, because it was a walk-on. I would have been fine to pass, myself. I don\u2019t dislike Thunderhawk; I respect it for its age and history. However, it doesn\u2019t match up to Phoenix, or Comet, or any of the wooden coasters at Kennywood; it\u2019s just kind of there. And that was this ride too; it was just there. It wasn\u2019t as violent as some rides in the past have been, so that was good, but it wasn\u2019t anything special. Steel Force The big attraction for a lot of folks was Steel Force, as many of them had ridden Mamba at Worlds of Fun recently, and wanted to compare Morgan hypers. Personally, I thought my Mamba ride was just OK, but many club members had stronger opinions. It had been a while since I rode Steel Force, and I\u2019ve gotten a lot more coaster experience in the intervening six years. (That\u2019s going to become a theme of this visit.) It didn\u2019t feel nearly so tall to me this time around, but there wasn\u2019t a lot of air on those first big hills. The helix pulled big positives, like it always does, and I think that surprised some people, as Mamba doesn\u2019t have that. The bunny hills on the way back to the station are fun; maybe there\u2019s one too many of them, or maybe that\u2019s sacrilegious to say. I liked it better than Mamba; the rest of the group didn\u2019t agree, but they liked it fine. Everybody else went on Possessed at that point. I chose to pass, because I\u2019ve done it before and I don\u2019t really care for Impulse coasters. Hydra: The Revenge After some random wandering, we headed back up the hill for Hydra. Our group got split at this point, into the older folks who\u2019d paid for fast-passes, and the younger ones who hadn\u2019t. I\u2019m far from a younger one, but I wasn\u2019t cred-running, so I didn\u2019t want to pay for a fast-pass. There was also some randomness with assigned seating, non-functioning seats, and strange grouping. As a result, I rode in row 3 with just one younger guy. He seemed pretty impressed with Hydra. Not that it has exceptional forces or anything, just that it\u2019s a B&M floorless that\u2019s not like all the others, due to the terrain. The jojo roll, the zero-g before anything else, the oddly-shaped cobra roll, the diving off the hillside. The point is that you don\u2019t really know what Hydra\u2019s going to do next, because it\u2019s non-standard, and that can be a lot of fun for enthusiasts. The others in the group didn\u2019t seem to agree, but I enjoyed it. Wild Mouse The group was headed for Talon, but encountered the Wild Mouse first, and it seemed to have no line, so they all hopped on. Unfortunately, it was quick for the fast-pass group, but not for the rest of us, so we were separated again. Even more unfortunately, the operations were terribly slow, so we ended up waiting a very long time. I\u2019ve had Wild Mouse on my credit list for a while, because I\u2019m sure I must have ridden it at some point, but I don\u2019t recall when. Regardless, now I\u2019m certain I\u2019ve done it. Nothing special to say about this one; it\u2019s an ordinary wild mouse coaster. Talon Because of our delay at Wild Mouse, the older group was long gone. So the younger folks and I went to Talon. Eventually; I forgot where the entrance was and guessed wrong. Anyway, although the operations were slow, there was very little line during a Haunt event. We took the last two rows, which afforded me an outside edge in row 7. Much like Hydra, Talon is a unique layout, and the darkness made it even more unpredictable. I got a little concerned about losing my glasses, so that hampered my enjoyment a bit, but it\u2019s a good collection of elements. Everyone agreed that it was a very good invert, but we found it hard to classify. Montu, Banshee, Afterburn, and Alpengeist are all better, for various reasons. Silver Bullet and Patriot probably rank below. Which leaves Talon on the low side of the curve, which seems unfair, but that\u2019s how it shakes out. We all agreed it depends on where we decide to rank the Batman clones on any given day. At that point, it was around 9ish, and knowing that I had a lot of driving to do tomorrow, I decided to take my leave. This proved to be an error, as lots of Buzzed Bars folks had arrived in the intervening time, and I missed my chance to join them for Steel Force and Talon takeovers.","title":"Dorney Park"},{"location":"coasters/2023/dorney/#dorney-park","text":"Visited: September 22, 2023 Attending: Brian, Buzzed Bars This event was an informal pre-game for the Sooper Dooper Stumble event.

The boarding group system, while efficient, doesn\u2019t give you any sense of what time you\u2019ll actually get to ride, a problem that came back to bite me the next day. So while we knew that it would be a while, we didn\u2019t know if that was two hours or four or what. Which put us in the position of having to kill time, but in small increments. Lunch We stopped at the Connections Eatery for lunch. Definitely not the fanciest place in Epcot, but centrally located, and doesn\u2019t require venturing onto the concrete desert that is World Showcase. In fact, we avoided World Showcase altogether. The food wasn\u2019t anything special, but it was indoors with seating, which was appreciated. Living with the Land Continuing our theme of \u201cindoors with seating,\u201d we went over to the Land pavilion for the Living with the Land ride, which we suspected (accurately) wouldn\u2019t have a line. It\u2019s an educational throwback to the earliest days of Epcot, although it\u2019s been updated a few times. It\u2019s basically a boat ride through various agricultural experiments. Interesting, to be sure, but not scintillating. Soarin\u2019 Soarin\u2019 was actually the primary reason we came to the Land pavilion. It\u2019s a \u201cflying theater,\u201d a copy of the one in California. We went because we thought it might be showing the original \u201cSoarin\u2019 Over California\u201d film that\u2019s only around for special occasions. However, we were a couple of weeks too early for that, so instead we got \u201cSoarin\u2019 Around the World,\u201d which is perfectly nice. It reminded me of a few global locations where I\u2019ve been recently, and several more I\u2019d like to go do. We rode from the third row, which is the lowest once the ride starts, and while it wasn\u2019t bad, I\u2019d prefer to do it from the center row sometime. Test Track At this point, it became clear that we would have an extended wait for Guardians, so Steven revised some of his evening plans, and we went to Test Track. Back in 2011, I\u2019d waited in the queue with the rest of my family, and then stepped out with Alex before the ride itself. I didn\u2019t recognize anything from my previous trip, so I suspect it\u2019s been heavily revised. The \u201cdesign your own car\u201d portion was similar to the \u201cSum of All Thrills\u201d ride, which is now gone, but I think Steven and I would have appreciated, as enthusiasts. Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind Finally, our boarding group was summoned, and we got in line for Guardians. Because of the way the virtual queue operates \u2013 or maybe just the way it was operating that day \u2013 we got to cruise right through most of the queue, which means I missed the bit where Peter Quill enthuses about Epcot. However, everybody gets stopped and bunched together for the pre-show, which includes a trick where all the riders are \u201cteleported\u201d to a Xandarian ship in orbit. Even though I had a pretty good idea how it would be done even before I saw the effect, I found it impressive and well-executed. The ride vehicles are also very cool, and Steven recommended waiting for the front row, which took only a bit of extra time. The ride itself is heavily story-driven, which I won\u2019t spoil. However, the trains are designed to sync up with the story. The cars can each rotate in position, not unlike Time Traveler, but the rotation is guided, not random. As a result, the front car becomes the rear one just before the initial launch, which is a very cool sensation. The ride itself isn\u2019t too intense, and reminded me a lot of Laff Trakk, with the indoor setting, bright show elements, and spinning cars. They seemed to specialize in rotating the cars to face either the inside or outside of a banked turn, which I\u2019ve learned is one of my favorite features of these spinners. The length also seemed quite good, although I always prefer a ride to be longer. And of course, there\u2019s the music. For our run, the track was \u201cI Ran (So Far Away)\u201d by A Flock of Seagulls, which is one of my favorite 80s-era hits, so I was well satisfied, both with the song in general, and how well it fit the ride.

It was set to open to the public on Friday June 2, with Media Day on June 1, but they offered three days of pass-holder preview before that, and the first of those coincided with Memorial Day. I, along with some other Buzzed Bars, was lucky enough to reserve a ticket in the first timeslot of the day, so I planned to head over there for a few hours early in the day. Candymonium I arrived at the park around 9:30, which was way early for my ticketed time, but I suspected club members would arrive early. I was right about that, but they chose to wait in the entrance line rather than tailgate in the parking lot. So we stood around having a good time until the gates opened at 10, and then we headed for Candymonium. With eight of us, we occupied rows 2 and 3 (apparently consensus is that it\u2019s a front-row ride). It was running nicely even early in the day, so it proved to be a good ride. This was only my second time riding it, but I do enjoy a B&M hyper. The second hill has very impressive sustained floater, several seconds worth, which is a good trick even for B&M. The turnaround is just OK, and then the trims take some of the fun out of the remaining camelbacks. The off-axis hill, sadly, just isn\u2019t worth it. And the final helix is kinda fun, but not terribly forceful. The first half is quality, the second half is just average. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a top-tier hyper. Wildcat\u2019s Revenge Although it was still pretty early, we wanted to make sure we were in plenty of time for Wildcat, so we headed over there. Had a bit of a wait in the crowd until the back of the park opened at 11, but they mostly went to the water park, so that was OK. The line was out onto the midway by the time we reached it, which was surprising; I didn\u2019t think there were that many pass-holders. However, they had ticket-scanners at multiple points in the line, and weren\u2019t using any of the switchbacks, so the queue wasn\u2019t bad at all. We saw Taylor and Sarah on their way out as we were heading in, so we gave them a wave. The queue passes right by the coaster, so you can get all kinds of views of several of the elements; it\u2019s great fun to watch while you\u2019re waiting. We noted some significant sway in the turns, and we could hear the timbers creaking for several seconds after the train had passed, which was strange. There are free pass-through lockers similar to Steel Vengeance, which aren\u2019t huge, but are pretty convenient. When we got to the platform, we were directed to rows 4 and 5. Not really where we\u2019d choose to be, but with this kind of crowd, we weren\u2019t going to argue. We noted that the restraints not only have vertical grab-handles (better than the straps), but also a large elastic loop in the middle. Not sure what that\u2019s for, but we didn\u2019t intend to hold on anyway. There\u2019s a lot of space for a pre-lift on this ride, and RMC makes the most of it. I wasn\u2019t expecting a wave turn before the lift. The first drop is decent, expected for the height. The underflip is sharp, almost violent. The second hill has the most definitive \u201csustained ejector\u201d I\u2019ve experienced yet. The stall is nice and long, probably about the same as Goliath\u2019s. I thought the ride was going to end after that, but I\u2019m pleased to have been wrong. There are a few more inversions, and they\u2019re very forceful. As well as a wall stall that\u2019s fun, but not exceptional. It hits the brakes with a good amount of speed still left in it, but that\u2019s standard for an RMC. The folks in our group who\u2019ve ridden Zadra think that \u201cmini-Zadra\u201d is a very apt description for Wildcat. I can agree from a visual perspective, but I\u2019ll mostly have to take their word for it. There was also a lot of comparison to Aerie Force 1, as the other new RMC for this year. The consensus is that they do very different things, so comparing them is apples-to-oranges. As for me, it reminded me most of Wicked Cyclone, in that the height deceives you into thinking it won\u2019t be terribly forceful, and then proves you wrong. But elements like the underflip and the wall-stall are more recent RMC tricks, so it feels like an updated Wicked Cyclone. I\u2019m not quite willing to place it yet without some more rides in different seats. It won\u2019t be dethroning Steel Vengeance, but it may well be the best coaster in this park. Lightning Racer With our appointment out of the way, we met up with some of the other club members, and decided on Lightning Racer as a good next choice. As the \u201cgood GCI\u201d in the park, it often feels fast and out of control, but in a good way. And having a race with other folks makes the whole thing even better. I didn\u2019t realize just how many times the two trains interact, and you can see the other riders. Our train won, by a whisker, which is always good fun. Skyrush When Buzzed Bars is at Hershey, they\u2019re going to ride Skyrush. Probably multiple times. I\u2019m learning that although the park itself can be crowded, Skyrush almost never is. It\u2019s not hugely scary, so I wonder if it\u2019s just gotten a reputation, like i305. Regardless, we did a round, and I took row 7, on the outside. I don\u2019t know if anything had changed since the last time I rode, but I didn\u2019t want to keep my hands up for the first drop. It felt like I had a little bit more room than usual, but of course it didn\u2019t stay that way. Skyrush definitely brings the intensity in a way that Candymonium doesn\u2019t. The rest of the gang opted for another round, but I was worried about attracting a headache before my ride home, so I passed. SooperDooperLooper The group decided to do the Looper, seeing as it was right there, and some folks hadn\u2019t done it. There was a bit more of a wait this time, but with one-train ops and awkward trains, that\u2019s to be expected. I still think this should make a great \u201cfirst inversion\u201d coaster for folks, but maybe the lack of shoulder restraints would bother people, I don\u2019t know. The initial loop is fun, not as dramatic as Revolution\u2019s. And that\u2019s really all there is to it, except for a rather punishing helix at the end. It was mid-afternoon at this point, so I decided to head home. I definitely enjoyed my primary goal, which was Wildcat\u2019s Revenge, but it was nice to see the rest of the club as well. I found out later that if I\u2019d hung out a while longer, I might have been able to score another ride, and possibly appear in a Coaster Studios video, but life\u2019s like that sometimes.","title":"HersheyPark"},{"location":"coasters/2023/hersheypark1/#hersheypark","text":"Visited: May 29, 2023 Attending: Brian, various Buzzed Bars (Kelli, JohnMike, Allison, Mullet, Lucas, others) The big attraction for this visit was Wildcat\u2019s Revenge, the new RMC built on the bones of the former Wildcat. It was set to open to the public on Friday June 2, with Media Day on June 1, but they offered three days of pass-holder preview before that, and the first of those coincided with Memorial Day. I, along with some other Buzzed Bars, was lucky enough to reserve a ticket in the first timeslot of the day, so I planned to head over there for a few hours early in the day.","title":"HersheyPark"},{"location":"coasters/2023/hersheypark1/#candymonium","text":"I arrived at the park around 9:30, which was way early for my ticketed time, but I suspected club members would arrive early. I was right about that, but they chose to wait in the entrance line rather than tailgate in the parking lot. So we stood around having a good time until the gates opened at 10, and then we headed for Candymonium. With eight of us, we occupied rows 2 and 3 (apparently consensus is that it\u2019s a front-row ride). It was running nicely even early in the day, so it proved to be a good ride. This was only my second time riding it, but I do enjoy a B&M hyper. The second hill has very impressive sustained floater, several seconds worth, which is a good trick even for B&M. The turnaround is just OK, and then the trims take some of the fun out of the remaining camelbacks. The off-axis hill, sadly, just isn\u2019t worth it. And the final helix is kinda fun, but not terribly forceful. The first half is quality, the second half is just average. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a top-tier hyper.","title":"Candymonium"},{"location":"coasters/2023/hersheypark1/#wildcats-revenge","text":"Although it was still pretty early, we wanted to make sure we were in plenty of time for Wildcat, so we headed over there. Had a bit of a wait in the crowd until the back of the park opened at 11, but they mostly went to the water park, so that was OK. The line was out onto the midway by the time we reached it, which was surprising; I didn\u2019t think there were that many pass-holders. However, they had ticket-scanners at multiple points in the line, and weren\u2019t using any of the switchbacks, so the queue wasn\u2019t bad at all. We saw Taylor and Sarah on their way out as we were heading in, so we gave them a wave. The queue passes right by the coaster, so you can get all kinds of views of several of the elements; it\u2019s great fun to watch while you\u2019re waiting. We noted some significant sway in the turns, and we could hear the timbers creaking for several seconds after the train had passed, which was strange. There are free pass-through lockers similar to Steel Vengeance, which aren\u2019t huge, but are pretty convenient. When we got to the platform, we were directed to rows 4 and 5. Not really where we\u2019d choose to be, but with this kind of crowd, we weren\u2019t going to argue. We noted that the restraints not only have vertical grab-handles (better than the straps), but also a large elastic loop in the middle.

Kate and her family live in New Jersey, so they hadn\u2019t been to Hershey in quite a long time. They are, however, Disney experts, and they brought some of that Disney mojo and determination to this trip. I got everybody bring-a-friend tickets with Sweet Start, and although we tried to get there as close to 9 as possible, it ended up being more like 9:45. I also got boxed out of the closest parking spots because of a concert at the stadium that I knew nothing about. The day turned out to be not terribly hot, but it was really crowded for a Friday. Fortunately, some crowd-dodging tricks were effective. Jude is a relatively new enthusiast (and a 9-year-old), so I had a \u201cmild to wild\u201d plan ready, although he was pretty game for most anything. Comet After making our way through the entrance, I took us down the secret path along the creek to the Hollow. We got an awfully good look at Skyrush, but that wasn\u2019t our goal for today. The plan was to hit up the Comet first, before the crowds got nasty. By my recollection, Kate rode the Comet back in 1990, although she says she doesn\u2019t remember. As usual, the Comet delivered quality, with some rumble and a little airtime. It was maybe a little rougher than I remembered, but it gets a pass due to its age. The important thing was that Jude liked it. SooperDooperLooper The Looper is right next door, and Jude pronounced himself ready for an inversion, so we did that next. Although he was ready, he did have some trepidation. I\u2019ve found that before their first loop, everybody expects to feel the pull of gravity, and there\u2019s no way to talk them out of that before they try it. Still, it went about as expected. The star of the show is the loop, but the helix at the end isn\u2019t anything to sneeze at either. Jolly Rancher Remix From there, we proceeded to Jolly Rancher. A boomerang may be a bit of a step up from the Looper, but it\u2019s the next logical progression if you\u2019re going to stick with inversions. Jude decided to ride with me this time, so I took a seat in the middle of the train for safety. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever done a boomerang from the middle before; there was a definite reduction in the amount of strange forces. The backwards climb was a bit higher than I thought, and there\u2019s always some tension before the drop, but that was cool. The cobra roll had a little bit of jank on it, especially backwards, but nothing major. The tunnel remains kind of a disappointment. There\u2019s a bit of fog, but I certainly can\u2019t smell anything. At this point, it was a bit after noon, and we\u2019d gotten three credits; a fine start. We decided to break for lunch at the BBQ restaurant near Trailblazer. Which was a good opportunity to discover that Trailblazer was closed. That\u2019s where I would have started, really, but clearly the point was moot. Alex also joined up with us around this point. Wild Mouse I don\u2019t know if the Wild Mouse was strictly necessary at this point, but Jude was a bit height-limited, so I wanted him to go on whatever he could. As we now had a group of five, Kate and Steven took one car, while Alex, Jude, and I took another. Kate and Steven were not ready for the forces a wild mouse puts on an adult body (I did warn them), and I think they disliked it strongly. Alex was experiencing it for the first time at adult height, so I think that surprised him as well. Jude seemed to think it was very funny. I don\u2019t find these things pleasant, but I wasn\u2019t really riding it for me, so that\u2019s all fine. Laff Trakk Laff Trakk is the only coaster at Hershey that I\u2019d never ridden, because the line is always absurdly long. It was today as well, but we just decided to stick it out (Alex eventually bailed in search of food). All I knew about this was that it was a compact, indoor, spinning coaster. I expected a spinning wild mouse, but I was mistaken about that. It\u2019s still compact, on a wild mouse footprint, but it doesn\u2019t have all the switchbacks. The spinning also wasn\u2019t very intense, so I was able to enjoy it, much like I did Time Traveler. It\u2019s indoors, and therefore dark, but it also has a number of well-lit props and decorations, which enabled me to see the path fairly well. I\u2019d be happy to ride this again, if I ever see it without a line. I think this was Kate\u2019s favorite ride of the day. After that, we rejoined Alex in front of Wildcat. Steven very much wanted to ride it, Alex was game, and it has a 48\u201d height restriction, so Jude could as well. Honestly, I\u2019m kind of surprised at that, and I thought it would be a substantial jump upward from where we were. I made sure everybody tried the test seat to see if they\u2019d feel secure, and they all liked it. However, once we got to a point where we could see the whole track, and specifically the vertical drop, Jude changed his mind. Honestly, I think that was probably the right call. Given universal trepidation, we all bailed on Wildcat this time. Fine with me; I was expecting more rides on it later in the year. Lightning Racer With Wildcat disposed of, we headed to the back of the park for Lightning Racer, which I thought was a good next step on the mild-to-wild trail. Jude was initially uncertain, but I suggested we split the party for a race, and that seemed to appeal. Kate and Jude went for Thunder (left) while Steven and I took Lightning (right). It\u2019s a rumbly ride, but lots of fun, and with the GCI twister layout, there\u2019s lots of opportunities for interaction. Much like last time I rode, having someone on the other train to wave at increases the enjoyment. Thunder won the race, by the way. Jude liked it so much that we all went around again, except for Kate. Although there was a fair bit of line, it moved swiftly, because they were running two trains on each side. We all went for Thunder this time around, which is pretty much the same ride, in my opinion. I don\u2019t think one is superior to the other. Jude proclaimed this the best coaster he rode that day, and I think that\u2019s a good assessment. The mild-to-wild trip stopped at this point, but I think that\u2019s great progress. Great Bear We headed back toward the front of the park, and stopped to ride the Ferris wheel and the Pirate ship (I passed on that one). We took a break and bought some lemonades, which were excellent, and then we rode Coal Cracker. None of that is a coaster, so I\u2019ll not go into detail. Great Bear is right by Coal Cracker, so we went over there next. Jude was below the height limit, which kind of surprised me, but he was feeling done for the day. Steven and I went on it while Kate and Jude visited the Kissing Tower and the antique cars. I talked Steven into waiting for the front row, which I knew was a bit of a risk, but I hoped it would pay off. I admit that there are better inverts in the world than Great Bear, but I really am fond of it. The initial helix provides great views, as does the drop. I admit there\u2019s a bit of a dead space along the creek as it heads back toward the brakes, but I\u2019m fine with that. The good news is that Steven enjoyed it quite a bit, and I was able to explain why B&M coasters are known for smoothness. That was a positive all-round. Candymonium At this point, we got some dinner at the Overlook (disappointing) and then went over to Simply Chocolate for a Milkshake The Size Of Your Head. One of them, anyway. I let Kate and Jude get one while Steven and I abstained. It\u2019s visually impressive and certainly worth it. By this point, the sun was starting to set, so we headed back toward the front. Steven had been interested in Candymonium from the start, which makes sense. It\u2019s right in the front of the park, it\u2019s huge, and it looks like fun. Kate had been unhappy that the coasters we\u2019d ridden beat her up a bit, and I suggested loosening up and going with the flow more than she had been. To encourage that, and because Jude isn\u2019t tall enough yet, I suggested that Steven and Kate ride while Jude and I checked out the gift shop. So this entry isn\u2019t about me. Both of them got off raving about the experience. I\u2019m not sure where in the train they were, but Kate was able to relax more, and they both reported experiencing good floater airtime. I think I\u2019ve made two new B&M fans. That makes me happy. I kinda forgot that once you enter the gift shop, you can\u2019t get back into the park; oops. We planned on visiting Chocolate World, so we didn\u2019t buy anything at that time. Unfortunately, Chocolate World was closed, and it was after eight, so we decided to be done for the day. There was one last surprise, though: the concert I mentioned earlier was Guns \u2018n Roses, and it was in full swing as we left. It\u2019s an open stadium, so we could certainly hear, although not the best quality. However, you could see straight onto the stage from the side, and that\u2019s where I\u2019d parked, so we got treated to \u201cWelcome to the Jungle\u201d while I hunted for the car.","title":"HersheyPark"},{"location":"coasters/2023/hersheypark2/#hersheypark","text":"Visited: August 11, 2023 Attending: Brian, Kate, Steven, Jude, Alex (for a bit) I had suggested to my sister Kate that we should do a HersheyPark trip this summer, since I had a season pass with the attendant perks.

One of them, anyway. I let Kate and Jude get one while Steven and I abstained. It\u2019s visually impressive and certainly worth it. By this point, the sun was starting to set, so we headed back toward the front. Steven had been interested in Candymonium from the start, which makes sense. It\u2019s right in the front of the park, it\u2019s huge, and it looks like fun. Kate had been unhappy that the coasters we\u2019d ridden beat her up a bit, and I suggested loosening up and going with the flow more than she had been. To encourage that, and because Jude isn\u2019t tall enough yet, I suggested that Steven and Kate ride while Jude and I checked out the gift shop. So this entry isn\u2019t about me. Both of them got off raving about the experience. I\u2019m not sure where in the train they were, but Kate was able to relax more, and they both reported experiencing good floater airtime. I think I\u2019ve made two new B&M fans. That makes me happy. I kinda forgot that once you enter the gift shop, you can\u2019t get back into the park; oops. We planned on visiting Chocolate World, so we didn\u2019t buy anything at that time. Unfortunately, Chocolate World was closed, and it was after eight, so we decided to be done for the day. There was one last surprise, though: the concert I mentioned earlier was Guns \u2018n Roses, and it was in full swing as we left. It\u2019s an open stadium, so we could certainly hear, although not the best quality. However, you could see straight onto the stage from the side, and that\u2019s where I\u2019d parked, so we got treated to \u201cWelcome to the Jungle\u201d while I hunted for the car.","title":"Candymonium"},{"location":"coasters/2023/hersheypark3/","text":"HersheyPark Visited: September 23, 2023 Attending: Brian, Buzzed Bars This was the main event of the Sooper Dooper Stumble, two days at Hershey with a picnic and ERT.

It did make me rather late getting to Kennywood, though. I arrived mid-afternoon, not intending to spend a ton of time, because I had a long drive in front of me. Sadly, as with my first trip, the park was quite busy. I had to park in the furthest parking lot and make my way down the hill. I was surprised to discover that there are actually three levels of parking lot. There\u2019s an escalator to get from level 2 to level 1, but if you\u2019ve parked all the way up on level 3, you get a steep switchback path down to level 2. Pittsburgh and their hills, I tell ya. Jack-Rabbit Once I got inside, it became clear that while the crowds weren\u2019t as bad as 2019, they were still pretty bad. Racer and Jack-Rabbit both had lines that spilled past their entrances. I was aware that whatever I rode next would be my 200th credit, and I wasn\u2019t about to give Steel Curtain that distinction. I\u2019d heard good things about Jack-Rabbit, and it\u2019s quite old as well, so I figured this would do. I got in line and waited, and waited, and waited, just in front of a family with one kid who was a world-class complainer, but she did stick it out the whole time. I snagged the back seat, noted the fixed grab-bar, but there was a seat belt. Unfortunately, just before dispatch, the ride op tightened the belt quite a bit. I didn\u2019t think you could get stapled with a seat belt, but I was mistaken. I really should have loosened it myself, but I didn\u2019t. Jack-Rabbit is very short, just a double loop that has a ditch in the middle, much like Thunderbolt on the other side of the park. The first drop is from ground level, and does pretty much nothing. After that turnaround, there\u2019s a lift, another turnaround, and the famous double-down. Which, unfortunately, did almost nothing for me, because my seat belt was so tight. I was expecting something Phoenix-like, but this wasn\u2019t that. I believe that the fault was mine (or the ride op\u2019s), and if I ride it again, I may experience the miracle, but sadly, for my #200, I was unimpressed. Steel Curtain After that, it was on to my spite coaster, Steel Curtain. I\u2019d attempted to ride this twice in the past, and been denied both times. Although the line wasn\u2019t spilling out onto the midway, this ride has rather more queue space than old woodens. I figured there was probably 45 minutes of waiting, but that was substantially less than my first try, so I resigned myself. Eventually, I made it onto the platform, boarded the train\u2026and then was asked to leave again, because someone had spotted blood on a seat a bit further up the train. Although I was cursing my luck, they didn\u2019t shut the ride down; just cleaned off the seat thoroughly and got back to business. So I finally got my ride. Which was\u2026eh? I can\u2019t for the life of me figure out how a ride that visually impressive can be flat and lifeless. I wasn\u2019t too sure about putting my hands up for that first inversion, because it\u2019s awfully high up, but then I realized that I wasn\u2019t experiencing much in the way of forces, so there was no sense of danger from putting my hands up. All the inversions seem to flow together into an undifferentiated mass, so you can\u2019t really count the elements even if you wanted to. I hoped the jump over the midway and its followup stall would be exciting, but the hill offered no air at all, and the stall was just a quick flip and then back again. It was over before it even got started, which isn\u2019t the way it looks from the ground. I can understand a ride being dull, but one with this much hype, that visually impressive, really should feel like something. It\u2019s a pretty effective demonstration that rides have to be designed well, not just link a bunch of elements together. So after two mediocre experiences, I really wanted to do something better. Unfortunately, Racer\u2019s line hadn\u2019t abated any, and Skyrocket\u2019s had gotten worse. It\u2019s a shame to pass up a ride on Phantom\u2019s Revenge, but I was already over an hour past when I\u2019d wanted to leave, not to mention the time I needed to get all the way back up to my car, so I just left.

Back in December, I had originally hoped to go to Knott\u2019s or Magic Mountain with some of my co-workers, but that plan fell through. When Buzzed Bars planned a trip to the same area in February, I was psyched, and I let my co-workers know in case they wanted to join. Things didn\u2019t go exactly as planned, with Tony and Jeanelle joining me for a few hours at Knotts, without really meeting anybody else in the club. We arrived much later than I\u2019d hoped, thanks to LA traffic, but it was still a reasonably fun day. Of course, right after I got back from the trip, we all got laid off, so that kind of puts a damper on the whole thing, but I\u2019ll try to set that aside. Silver Bullet It was around 5:00 when we got into the park, with the sun starting to go down. I wasn\u2019t too concerned about lines, as the club had reported no problems so far. Jeanelle suggested we start with Silver Bullet, as it was right there. A quick mental inventory told me that Silver Bullet is middle-of-the-road for Knott\u2019s coasters, so I figured that would be a pretty good place to start. I don\u2019t think I realized how much my attitude toward coasters has changed since becoming a serious enthusiast, because both of my colleagues expressed trepidation before riding something that I don\u2019t consider to be a big deal. In an attempt to minimize discomfort, I selected row 4, and the others went along, taking the inside seats, which likely blocked most of their view, but that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing. With a better idea of what to expect this time, I remembered that the initial drop is shallow, but still builds up speed. I was ready for the forceful cobra roll (thank you, Alpengeist, for teaching me that), and I knew the final helix would be intense. I didn\u2019t give much thought to the zero-g rolls, because I love those, but Jeanelle distinctly did not. On the brake run, I expressed my appreciation, but both Tony and Jeanelle said they were dizzy. Under the circumstances, following up with Sierra Sidewinder seemed like a really bad choice. But since we were going that way anyhow, I figured Jaguar! would fit the bill as a fairly mild option. Unfortunately, once we got over there, I discovered that Jaguar was closed, along with the entire plaza, because of the renovations to Montezooma. I was really thrown off, because there was a sign for Jaguar and everything, but no actual entrance. We already knew Xcelerator was closed (although we stopped and looked at the new paint), but it seemed we\u2019d walked around the north end of the park for no reason at all. And then I made things worse by refusing to consider Coast Rider. I told the others I\u2019d wait while they rode it if they wanted, but once again they chose to go with my opinion. So now we were standing by HangTime. Hang Time Personally, I consider HangTime to be more intense than Silver Bullet, so I was worried that Jeanelle and Tony wouldn\u2019t want to ride, but Jeanelle was firm in her belief that it was the corkscrews that had been a problem, and HangTime doesn\u2019t have any, so. I did make them watch a cycle so they could see the hang and the dive, as well as the vertical lift, but they said they were all OK with that, and it was a station wait, so away we went. I went for a middle row again, for safety, and took the inside edge for myself. The outside seat was occupied by a girl, maybe eight years old, who had her hands up the entire time, much to Tony\u2019s chagrin. I\u2019m still not overly fond of a vertical lift, so I\u2019ll admit I hung on for that part. I made sure to get a good look around from the top, because I usually forget to do that on dive coasters. It was a nice clear day, around sunset, so it was all quite pretty. The drop was roughly what I expected. I still enjoy the non-inverting loop, and there\u2019s an airtime hill about halfway through that was fun. \u201cFun\u201d is about the right word for this one, although I find it a bit short. Jeanelle and Tony both said they liked it a lot, which improved my mood. Pony Express Pony Express was the only coaster that had been down when I was at Knotts in 2019, so that allowed me to explain the concept of the \u201c+1 trip\u201d to Tony and Jeanelle, who were amused by the whole thing. They were also pretty amused by my description of Pony Express as a family coaster, and by the cars and the restraints. Which I have to admit are very unusual. This is the first time I\u2019ve ridden one of these \u201cmotorbike-style\u201d trains, and having a pad come up and rest on the small of my back was very odd. I also made the same mistake I always make with launches, where I assume if it\u2019s not one of the super-forceful ones, then it\u2019s no big deal, especially after watching a couple of cycles, but they\u2019re always a bit stronger than I think they\u2019re going to be. Other than that, Pony Express isn\u2019t anything to write home about. A couple of curves, a little bit of air, and it\u2019s done. Not even much of a view, because it\u2019s not tall enough, but it was a gorgeous sunset. GhostRider We\u2019d now come back around to the front of the park and GhostRider, which both Tony and Jeanelle remembered from prior visits, but hadn\u2019t ridden in a while, so probably before the GCI retracking. Although GhostRider has notoriously long lines, this was a station wait, so we were lucky. It was also well past sunset and into twilight at this point, so fairly close to a night ride. GhostRider was the coaster that made me believe in night rides, back in 2019, and it didn\u2019t disappoint. That thing is just nuts, especially at night, and it was certainly hauling on this day. The drops, the laterals, and the general out-of-control feeling are all top-shelf in my book. Tony seemed really fired up after that one, and Jeanelle seemed to enjoy it too, although it may have been a bit much. Since we were back at the entrance at this point, Tony and Jeanelle decided to take their leave, as they had a long ride home. I took the opportunity to zip out to the parking lot to swap my shades for my regular glasses before heading back in again. GhostRider again Fortunately, it didn\u2019t take me long to find the Buzzed Bars, as they were clustered by the entrance to GhostRider. After spending a while greeting one another, we headed inside. The line had gotten rather longer in the interval, somehow, but we didn\u2019t really mind, as we had time for catching up. There were enough of us that we accomplished a full-train takeover; I sat in row 2, marking the first time I\u2019d ever ridden GhostRider with someone else in the same row. With a train full of adults, some of us sizeable, the train seemed to be going even faster than the previous run. Being in the front didn\u2019t diminish any of the forces, and the second half of the ride still seemed crazy and out-of-control. Riding with friends is always better than riding alone, and riding with a full train of enthusiast friends is even better. Hang Time again After GhostRider, we reached that odd dynamic that happens sometimes when too many people are standing around and talking about what they want to ride next, and so nobody does anything. I thought I\u2019d convinced a small group to go ride Hang Time, but I lost a bunch of them in transit, so I ended up going over there with just Scott from Upstop Media and Anthony from, well, the Cleveland Browns. I hadn\u2019t met Anthony before, but he was very polite, if a bit quiet. Hang Time still didn\u2019t have much of a wait, so we grabbed the back row easily. It turns out that even professional coaster documenters and NFL players aren\u2019t overly fond of the sensations caused by a vertical lift, so that\u2019s nice to know. The light package was in full effect, but it\u2019s a little hard to notice that while you\u2019re on it. It does seem unusually bright for a nighttime coaster ride. As before, it\u2019s a lot of fun, but a bit on the short side. At this point, folks were gravitating back to the front of the park, either to head out for the breweries or up to Valencia. I looked for anyone who wanted a ride north, but didn\u2019t get any takers, so I headed that way my own self.","title":"Knott's Berry Farm"},{"location":"coasters/2023/knottsberryfarm/#knotts-berry-farm","text":"Visited: February 10, 2023 Attending: Brian, Tony Tran, Jeanelle Horcasitas, Buzzed Bars This trip was a little bit on the strange side. Back in December, I had originally hoped to go to Knott\u2019s or Magic Mountain with some of my co-workers, but that plan fell through. When Buzzed Bars planned a trip to the same area in February, I was psyched, and I let my co-workers know in case they wanted to join. Things didn\u2019t go exactly as planned, with Tony and Jeanelle joining me for a few hours at Knotts, without really meeting anybody else in the club. We arrived much later than I\u2019d hoped, thanks to LA traffic, but it was still a reasonably fun day. Of course, right after I got back from the trip, we all got laid off, so that kind of puts a damper on the whole thing, but I\u2019ll try to set that aside.","title":"Knott\u2019s Berry Farm"},{"location":"coasters/2023/knottsberryfarm/#silver-bullet","text":"It was around 5:00 when we got into the park, with the sun starting to go down. I wasn\u2019t too concerned about lines, as the club had reported no problems so far. Jeanelle suggested we start with Silver Bullet, as it was right there. A quick mental inventory told me that Silver Bullet is middle-of-the-road for Knott\u2019s coasters, so I figured that would be a pretty good place to start. I don\u2019t think I realized how much my attitude toward coasters has changed since becoming a serious enthusiast, because both of my colleagues expressed trepidation before riding something that I don\u2019t consider to be a big deal. In an attempt to minimize discomfort, I selected row 4, and the others went along, taking the inside seats, which likely blocked most of their view, but that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing. With a better idea of what to expect this time, I remembered that the initial drop is shallow, but still builds up speed. I was ready for the forceful cobra roll (thank you, Alpengeist, for teaching me that), and I knew the final helix would be intense. I didn\u2019t give much thought to the zero-g rolls, because I love those, but Jeanelle distinctly did not. On the brake run, I expressed my appreciation, but both Tony and Jeanelle said they were dizzy. Under the circumstances, following up with Sierra Sidewinder seemed like a really bad choice. But since we were going that way anyhow, I figured Jaguar! would fit the bill as a fairly mild option. Unfortunately, once we got over there, I discovered that Jaguar was closed, along with the entire plaza, because of the renovations to Montezooma. I was really thrown off, because there was a sign for Jaguar and everything, but no actual entrance. We already knew Xcelerator was closed (although we stopped and looked at the new paint), but it seemed we\u2019d walked around the north end of the park for no reason at all. And then I made things worse by refusing to consider Coast Rider. I told the others I\u2019d wait while they rode it if they wanted, but once again they chose to go with my opinion. So now we were standing by HangTime.","title":"Silver Bullet"},{"location":"coasters/2023/knottsberryfarm/#hang-time","text":"Personally, I consider HangTime to be more intense than Silver Bullet, so I was worried that Jeanelle and Tony wouldn\u2019t want to ride, but Jeanelle was firm in her belief that it was the corkscrews that had been a problem, and HangTime doesn\u2019t have any, so. I did make them watch a cycle so they could see the hang and the dive, as well as the vertical lift, but they said they were all OK with that, and it was a station wait, so away we went. I went for a middle row again, for safety, and took the inside edge for myself. The outside seat was occupied by a girl, maybe eight years old, who had her hands up the entire time, much to Tony\u2019s chagrin. I\u2019m still not overly fond of a vertical lift, so I\u2019ll admit I hung on for that part. I made sure to get a good look around from the top, because I usually forget to do that on dive coasters. It was a nice clear day, around sunset, so it was all quite pretty. The drop was roughly what I expected. I still enjoy the non-inverting loop, and there\u2019s an airtime hill about halfway through that was fun. \u201cFun\u201d is about the right word for this one, although I find it a bit short. Jeanelle and Tony both said they liked it a lot, which improved my mood.","title":"Hang Time"},{"location":"coasters/2023/knottsberryfarm/#pony-express","text":"Pony Express was the only coaster that had been down when I was at Knotts in 2019, so that allowed me to explain the concept of the \u201c+1 trip\u201d to Tony and Jeanelle, who were amused by the whole thing. They were also pretty amused by my description of Pony Express as a family coaster, and by the cars and the restraints. Which I have to admit are very unusual. This is the first time I\u2019ve ridden one of these \u201cmotorbike-style\u201d trains, and having a pad come up and rest on the small of my back was very odd. I also made the same mistake I always make with launches, where I assume if it\u2019s not one of the super-forceful ones, then it\u2019s no big deal, especially after watching a couple of cycles, but they\u2019re always a bit stronger than I think they\u2019re going to be. Other than that, Pony Express isn\u2019t anything to write home about. A couple of curves, a little bit of air, and it\u2019s done. Not even much of a view, because it\u2019s not tall enough, but it was a gorgeous sunset.","title":"Pony Express"},{"location":"coasters/2023/knottsberryfarm/#ghostrider","text":"We\u2019d now come back around to the front of the park and GhostRider, which both Tony and Jeanelle remembered from prior visits, but hadn\u2019t ridden in a while, so probably before the GCI retracking. Although GhostRider has notoriously long lines, this was a station wait, so we were lucky. It was also well past sunset and into twilight at this point, so fairly close to a night ride. GhostRider was the coaster that made me believe in night rides, back in 2019, and it didn\u2019t disappoint. That thing is just nuts, especially at night, and it was certainly hauling on this day. The drops, the laterals, and the general out-of-control feeling are all top-shelf in my book. Tony seemed really fired up after that one, and Jeanelle seemed to enjoy it too, although it may have been a bit much. Since we were back at the entrance at this point, Tony and Jeanelle decided to take their leave, as they had a long ride home. I took the opportunity to zip out to the parking lot to swap my shades for my regular glasses before heading back in again.","title":"GhostRider"},{"location":"coasters/2023/knottsberryfarm/#ghostrider-again","text":"Fortunately, it didn\u2019t take me long to find the Buzzed Bars, as they were clustered by the entrance to GhostRider. After spending a while greeting one another, we headed inside. The line had gotten rather longer in the interval, somehow, but we didn\u2019t really mind, as we had time for catching up. There were enough of us that we accomplished a full-train takeover; I sat in row 2, marking the first time I\u2019d ever ridden GhostRider with someone else in the same row. With a train full of adults, some of us sizeable, the train seemed to be going even faster than the previous run. Being in the front didn\u2019t diminish any of the forces, and the second half of the ride still seemed crazy and out-of-control.

This year it was slightly earlier, late July instead of early August, but it still requires a two-day drive to get there. And because I\u2019m more or less doing my own planning, and my employer doesn\u2019t care, I fit in a lot of coastering. Lakemont Park is in Altoona, PA, which is close enough that I feel like I should have gone before now, but it\u2019s also far enough away that it takes a dedicated trip to get there, which didn\u2019t seem worth it for what the park is. But if I had to drive all the way west anyway, I could make it work, so I did. I left my house late enough to get to Lakemont around noon, which I knew would complicate any plans I had for the rest of the day, but more about that later. I\u2019m not really sure what I was expecting, maybe a run-down old park like West Point, or that place Carole\u2019s company picnic has been held in the past, but this wasn\u2019t that. It was quite nice, part of a complex with a minor-league baseball stadium and some other indoor venues. I had no trouble finding parking near the entrance, and there wasn\u2019t much in the way of crowds. Most of the people there were using the picnic venues for birthday parties and such. There\u2019s a couple of miniature golf courses, playing fields, some food venues, go-karts, and two roller coasters (plus one kiddie). It all looked surprisingly well maintained, and I get the feeling the park actually does OK as a community attraction. Unfortunately, I\u2019d been warned by a Buzzed Bars member that the coasters weren\u2019t open, but I tried anyway. Leap the Dips Once I got inside the park, it was fairly easy to spot Leap the Dips and the Skyliner, and equally clear that neither was running. I wandered over to Skyliner first, because it was closer, and it had a \u201cclosed for maintenance\u201d sign and everything. So I walked down to where Leap the Dips is, intended to take some photos. I noticed a worker actively doing something on the track, so I figured that was that. A woman was there with her kids, and she was telling them about the history of the coaster, so it\u2019s not like I was the only one being nerdy. We both looked around what I guess would be the queuing area, just off the platform. While we were doing that, the worker came over and said that if we\u2019d give him half an hour, he\u2019d probably have the coaster up and running. That was a very pleasant surprise, so I decided that I would hang around. The nearby burger place wasn\u2019t half bad, if a bit slow, but it was cheap. After a while, I went back and sat on a bench in the queuing area, and I saw several workers examining the ride, and they agreed it was OK to run. One-train ops, which on this means one-car ops, but since there wasn\u2019t a line, that was no big deal. I purchased a ticket for all of $3, and it\u2019s a nice commemorative ticket too. When I got back, the ride op was explaining to some pre-teens that the ride works better the more weight there is in the car. The kids saw me, and immediately asked if I would ride with them, which I found very amusing. I agreed, and sat in the back, pretty much at random. I immediately noticed that there\u2019s not only no seat belts of any kind, the bar that I assumed was a rudimentary buzz bar is actually fixed in place, and just there to grab onto if you want. As we went up the lift, I was amused by the anti-rollback devices to either side. It\u2019s the same principle as modern anti-rollbacks, just much, much larger, more spread out, and made of wood. I suspect they\u2019d work just fine, though. The ride is a series of figure-8s with a gradual slope, and a \u201cdip\u201d at each level where the track crosses over itself. The first thing I noticed is that the car took the first turnaround at a decent clip, surprising, given that there\u2019s no safety measures at all. I was expecting to sit casually in the car with my arms draped on the side, but that first dip was no joke, and I found myself grabbing for the bar. Not that I necessarily thought I\u2019d be thrown out, but I felt myself come off the seat, and I\u2019m pretty sure I felt the wheels leave the track on the uphill. That\u2019s not a feeling I associate with roller coasters, so it was certainly unique. The dip is the only element this thing has, unless you count the 180-degree turns, so it was fun that they were repeated several times, so you could really enjoy them. The last ground-level dip seems to be a bit larger than the rest, and it\u2019s followed by a double-dip on the way back to the station. With the complete lack of restraints, I\u2019d have to say it was a bit thrilling, much to my surprise. The ride op seemed to think that the back seat was inferior, and offered to let me go around again, from the front. When I said I\u2019d only paid for the one ride, he said it was fine, because I was providing a service by adding ballast to the cars. Not completely sure how I feel about that, but I\u2019ll take it in the spirit it was intended. So I got to go around again, this time with some older teens. Amusingly, they reacted as though it were a newer, more thrilling coaster, which I thought was great. Some of my favorite coaster rides are the ones where I can\u2019t help but laugh all the way through them, and this was definitely that. On top of everything, it was a gorgeous day for coaster riding, cooler than usual for late July.

I didn\u2019t have much vacation time saved up, but I took three days of PTO after our official week in the office. Carole came down to join me, and we did a lot of touristy stuff in Sydney, but decided not to go beyond that this time. So no Dreamworld for me on this trip, but Luna Park Sydney is right there, right next to the Harbour Bridge, in an absolutely fabulous location, so I had to make an effort to snag some Australian credits. Luna Park Sydney is tiny, and the rides are kinda packed in there, but the atmosphere is strong. It\u2019s very carnival-like for an amusement park. The park is free to walk around in, and therefore has multiple entrances and exits. Rides require the purchase of a wristband. The park is also home to a wooden wild mouse, one of the only ones in the world. It\u2019s also built in a spot where you get great views of the harbor. And it\u2019s supposed to be unbearably rough. However, it was closed for retracking while I was there, which is kind of a shame. Still, the end result should be smoother. Big Dipper Luna Park has had three coasters called Big Dipper. The first was a traditional wooden coaster that was damaged by fire in 1979. The second was an Arrow looper that only ran from 1996 to 2001, because the park had an on-and-off history during that time. The current Big Dipper is a first-of-its-kind Intamin single-rail \u201cHot Racer\u201d model, at the moment the only one in the world. So that was a good reason to check out the park. The park is on a tiny plot, and the coaster is really squeezed in, such that it\u2019s hard to see from just about anywhere. It\u2019s also not too large, by Intamin standards. Part of the problem with the previous Big Dipper was that it was too big and too noisy. There are apartments nearby, and office buildings right up to the edge of the park \u2013 the coaster flies right past several balconies, which I would think has to be very distracting. The ride itself has a couple of rolling launches \u2013 tire-driven, not LSMs that you would expect, but they\u2019ve still got a decent kick. It\u2019s got a non-inverting loop, which is always a fun element, but then it\u2019s got a dive loop and a corkscrew, so it\u2019s not like they\u2019re afraid of inversions. It\u2019s short, which is to be expected, but it\u2019s good fun. I got a couple of rides, once from the middle and once from the front car. I\u2019m not sure if the back provides a better experience, but the front car was quite good. Like other single-rails, it\u2019s got one-across seating, so when you\u2019re in the front, it feels like it\u2019s just you and the track, which is pretty cool. Unfortunately, it went down for a while when I was in line for the second lap, so rather than going around again, I moved on. Boomerang Of all the coasters named \u201cBoomerang\u201d in the world, this one must be the most authentic. It\u2019s not a Vekoma Boomerang model, though: even though those are popular with small parks because of their compact footprint, it would be way too large to fit in Luna Park. The park is just that small. This is still a shuttle coaster, though, but a much smaller Gerstlauer model. It starts with a backwards chain lift, like a Vekoma, drops back through the station, and then there\u2019s a curve, a low helix, and another spike. Then it does the whole thing backwards. One odd thing about this model, though, is that the initial backwards lift hill levels off at the top. I went for the last car because I suspected that the back of the train might get a pop of air going from the level section to the drop. I was right about that, but that was pretty much the only moment of interest on this ride. At 40 feet, it\u2019s barely above kiddie ride status, to be honest. I might have dismissed it, except there was an actual kiddie coaster right next door, and I had to ride something other than Big Dipper to make the trip worth it. The operations were abysmal, and when you combine that with a shuttle coaster, the queue takes forever. So I basically used up the rest of my available time on this thing, and the sun was going down, so I left. That\u2019s about as low-key of a park visit as I\u2019ve ever made, but I wasn\u2019t going to pass up the chance for roller coasters Down Under. Hopefully I can visit one of the major parks in the future.","title":"Luna Park"},{"location":"coasters/2023/lunapark/#luna-park","text":"Visited: June 10, 2023 Attending: Just Brian In April of 2023, I took a new job with UpGuard, a company headquartered in Australia, and my department asked the American employees to come down there in early June.

It\u2019s short, which is to be expected, but it\u2019s good fun. I got a couple of rides, once from the middle and once from the front car. I\u2019m not sure if the back provides a better experience, but the front car was quite good. Like other single-rails, it\u2019s got one-across seating, so when you\u2019re in the front, it feels like it\u2019s just you and the track, which is pretty cool. Unfortunately, it went down for a while when I was in line for the second lap, so rather than going around again, I moved on.","title":"Big Dipper"},{"location":"coasters/2023/lunapark/#boomerang","text":"Of all the coasters named \u201cBoomerang\u201d in the world, this one must be the most authentic. It\u2019s not a Vekoma Boomerang model, though: even though those are popular with small parks because of their compact footprint, it would be way too large to fit in Luna Park. The park is just that small. This is still a shuttle coaster, though, but a much smaller Gerstlauer model. It starts with a backwards chain lift, like a Vekoma, drops back through the station, and then there\u2019s a curve, a low helix, and another spike. Then it does the whole thing backwards. One odd thing about this model, though, is that the initial backwards lift hill levels off at the top. I went for the last car because I suspected that the back of the train might get a pop of air going from the level section to the drop. I was right about that, but that was pretty much the only moment of interest on this ride. At 40 feet, it\u2019s barely above kiddie ride status, to be honest. I might have dismissed it, except there was an actual kiddie coaster right next door, and I had to ride something other than Big Dipper to make the trip worth it. The operations were abysmal, and when you combine that with a shuttle coaster, the queue takes forever. So I basically used up the rest of my available time on this thing, and the sun was going down, so I left. That\u2019s about as low-key of a park visit as I\u2019ve ever made, but I wasn\u2019t going to pass up the chance for roller coasters Down Under. Hopefully I can visit one of the major parks in the future.","title":"Boomerang"},{"location":"coasters/2023/magickingdom/","text":"Magic Kingdom Visited: Septmeber 13, 2023 Attending: Just Brian After doing Disney with a guide the day before, I was ready to go it alone today, although not without some trepidation. The big coaster for today was TRON, but I figured I\u2019d want to spend more time at Hollywood Studios than Magic Kingdom, so I was planning to start in Hollywood and then park-hop to Magic Kingdom. Steven convinced me that would be detrimental to my getting to ride TRON, so I switched my park plans. He was probably right, but the result was that I spent a lot more time at Magic Kingdom than I intended, and it was plenty hot. On the one hand, it was kind of nice walking around the place and seeing things that I normally wouldn\u2019t take the time to see. On the other hand, I didn\u2019t have a choice in the matter, so that made me a bit unhappy. Who wants to be unhappy in the Happiest Place on Earth? Monorail For those who don\u2019t know, the Magic Kingdom parking lot is nowhere near the park entrance. You have to take either a steamboat or the monorail to get to the park. I understand that\u2019s part of the immersion, but it\u2019s not really the most enjoyable experience. And the parking lots are not part of the immersion experience, at any of the parks. They\u2019re just vast asphalt deserts. There aren\u2019t even all that many signs, which surprised me. Anyway, I took the monorail over, and made Simpsons jokes in my head the whole way. PeopleMover I made my reservation for TRON right at 7 a.m., and was assigned boarding group 99. There\u2019s absolutely no way of judging how long it\u2019ll take before your group is called, which is a distinct disadvantage compared to the older system. So I foolishly thought I should hang out in Tomorrowland for a while, in case I got a relatively quick call. That\u2019s what they call \u201chubris,\u201d folks. Space Mountain was closed at that particular moment, so I hopped on the PeopleMover because it\u2019s shady and partially indoors. Not much to say about the PeopleMover; it\u2019s lengthy, it\u2019s shaded, and it\u2019s mildly amusing, so it did what I was looking for. Space Mountain As I reached the end of the PeopleMover, I could see that Space Mountain had opened, and I watched as the stated wait time jumped from 10 to 20 minutes, then to 30 by the time I reached it. Fortunately, that wasn\u2019t really the case, and I got on fairly quickly. Although I didn\u2019t ride it in 2011, I\u2019ve of course heard a lot about it over the years. I found the trains unexpectedly comfy, with a good amount of cushioning. I\u2019ve ridden enough dark, indoor coasters now to have some idea of what to expect, so nothing particularly startled me. There\u2019s some dips, and some turns, and that\u2019s really about all there is. It\u2019s a bit longer than I expected, so I spent some time trying to figure out how close to the floor we were, with the little light I could see. On the whole, it was perfectly fine, and I\u2019d do it again. Carousel of Progress It was becoming clear to me now that I wasn\u2019t going to be called any time soon, so I figured I\u2019d view the Carousel of Progress, because I\u2019d never done that before, and it was indoors. Not much to say about this that hasn\u2019t been said before. The content is fairly cheesy and overly optimistic, but the animatronics aren\u2019t bad, considering their age. Pirates of the Caribbean I\u2019d exhausted everything I wanted to do in Tomorrowland at this point, so I figured I might as well see what was going on in other areas of the park. I\u2019ve never done Pirates of the Caribbean, so I headed over that way. The queue was long, but shaded, if not indoors, and it moved along nicely. I found it a bit too noisy to tell much about the story, so it was a bit lost on me, but the animatronics were cool. Lunch I had a quick lunch at Pecos Bill\u2019s in Frontierland, because that seemed as far away from the middle of the park as I could get, and there was plenty of seating. Using the app to order was a lot better than standing in line. Walking with too long lines At this point, I started getting a bit frustrated at how slowly the TRON virtual queue was moving, and it dawned on me that I was likely to be there all day. I wandered through Frontierland and Fantasyland to see if anything caught my attention, but by this point, the park was getting crowded, and just about everything had 30-minute-plus lines, some of which were outside in the sun. Nothing really seemed all that interesting, and I was starting to get annoyed. PhilharMagic This is a concert of Disney music with 3D effects. I mostly chose it because it was likely to last a while, and had to be indoors. Both of which were true. What I had momentarily forgotten was that I like Disney musicals, so my mood was a bit better when I left. Also noted: the kids in the audience responded much better to Coco than to The Lion King. Huh. The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh This was a real act of desperation. I\u2019d heard that Pooh\u2019s Hunny Hunt was a remarkable trackless dark ride well worth experiencing, but I didn\u2019t remember exactly which park that ride is in. Turns out it\u2019s in Tokyo, not Florida. What I got was a very traditional dark ride with a gentle Pooh theme. I\u2019ve since learned that it\u2019s on the site where Mr. Toad\u2019s Wild Ride once was, so that\u2019s mildly interesting. Big Thunder Mountain I\u2019d passed by Big Thunder Mountain earlier, but decided not to ride because a large part of the queue was outside in the sun. I\u2019d ridden it in 2011 and enjoyed it, but it wasn\u2019t a high priority for me this time around, as I already had the credit. At this point, with nothing better to do, I decided to stick it out. The queue moved fairly steadily, and the outdoor part didn\u2019t last too long, relatively speaking, but that indicates the length of the queue more than anything. Big Thunder is a lot of fun, but nothing particularly wild. It has curves, and that\u2019s about all. There are some drops, but nothing I would describe as airtime. It\u2019s a great transitional coaster for kids who are just starting to get into it. Railroad Since I was now as far from TRON as I could possibly get, I decided to take the train. After all, Walt Disney loved trains, and they were a primary reason he built Disneyland, so why not? There\u2019s famously no train station in Tomorrowland (although there could be), so I had to ride all the way around to the front of the park and walk back. TRON Lightcycle / Run Yeah, the name is punctuated stupidly, but there it is. After waiting until nearly 4:00 for my boarding group to be called, I eagerly joined the queue and\u2026waited another 45 minutes or so in line. Makes me wonder what the point of the virtual queue was. The queue wasn\u2019t even particularly entertaining. Lots of blue glowy panels, a safety video, and that was all. The indoor portions, especially the loading platform, are really atmospheric, and I made sure to keep my sunglasses on so I looked as cyberpunk as I possibly could. The ride vehicles are extremely cool, shaped like motorcycles. Once you hop on and pull the handlebars toward you, the restraints engage on your back and behind your calves. Some folks have difficulty with the calf restraints, but I didn\u2019t. There\u2019s also a really cool compartment in front of the handlebars where you can stow your phone and glasses. (Larger bags need to go in a locker, which is a very cool double-sided locker, but not nearly as cool as a compartment on the vehicle.) Supposedly, it\u2019s a race, and the riders are supposed to stick together as a team (not hard, since they\u2019re linked on the train). As an older person, I remember lightcycles from the original TRON, and their defining characteristic was that they raced on a grid, trailing solid walls behind them, and turned at right angles. Obviously, these trains can\u2019t do any of those things. The outdoor portion is a nice, graceful curve, which doesn\u2019t seem to fit the theme at all. Indoors, there\u2019s more swooping curves, and some stuff happening on video screens, but I definitely didn\u2019t get the sense of a story, or a race. I suspect a night ride would be much better, but good luck getting one of those. I was left rather nonplussed on the whole, which I\u2019m sure had something to do with the extreme wait. It also had something to do with riding Guardians the day before. Both rides are new in Orlando, but Guardians is a brand-new design; Tron is a copy of the coaster at Shanghai Disney, which opened in 2015. A few short years shouldn\u2019t make that much difference in design, and yet, it does. I\u2019ll happily ride TRON again if the lines are at more reasonable levels. By the time I got off TRON, it was a little after 5. I needed to get back to my hotel, shower, and meet a friend for dinner at 6.

However, Allison talked me into coming with a small group to do Marineland as well. If you don\u2019t know the history of Marineland, watch a video, because I can\u2019t really do it justice. It\u2019s gigantic, mostly empty, and has the feel of an abandoned park that\u2019s not quite abandoned yet. The primary goal, in fact the only goal, was Dragon Mountain, a storied old Arrow, but it\u2019s a long walk to get there, and we got distracted by some kiddie rides and animal exhibits on the way.

There were also no people, so we didn\u2019t get much time to appreciate it all. The station itself was very dimly lit, and there was only one train operator, plus the one at the panel. The boarding process was naturally quite slow, but it\u2019s not like we were holding up the line at all. The operator was kind about letting us sit wherever we wanted, so Mullet, Allison, and I took the back, with Meg and Marc in the front, and off we went. The lift hill felt something like an alpine coaster, because it was technically on the ground, but the ground is an absurdly steel slope. The two vertical loops felt pretty much like Arrow loops, with odd forces because we were sitting in the back. Then there\u2019s an absurd amount of straight track as we made our way into the mountain. The only thing inside is two loops of helix, which isn\u2019t particularly exciting. There\u2019s one point where the track visibly drops to a lower level, and we thought that would be janky, but it wasn\u2019t, at least not in the back. The batwing again had those odd forces, but we had so little speed left, I wondered if we were going to valley. For all that it was odd, it was unexpectedly pleasant for an old Arrow.

If I went straight east from the Dells, I could encounter Michigan\u2019s Adventure and Canada\u2019s Wonderland before turning south to go home, so that was the plan. Unfortunately, the original plan involved crossing Lake Michigan on a ferry, which would save a lot of time, and sounded like fun too. However, the ferry sold out for Friday the 28th before I even left on my trip, so I had to drive south around the bottom of the lake, which took considerably longer. But I still got to Michigan\u2019s Adventure around mid-day. It\u2019s a pleasant small park around a little lake in the middle. It\u2019s smaller even than Dorney or Worlds of Fun, making it the smallest Cedar Fair park I\u2019ve been to. And its coaster collection is similarly small. It has a massive parking lot for some reason, but that gives a lot of space to show off Shivering Timbers, which if nothing else, is extremely photogenic. Shivering Timbers This was my highest priority for this trip, and the ride that Buzzed Bars had enjoyed most during their recent Stumble, so I was optimistic. The line wasn\u2019t particularly long, and I managed a back-car ride with another man of roughly my age, who was with his two kids. It\u2019s got an out-and-back layout right along the edge of the park, which contributes to its photogenic nature. It\u2019s just one hill after another all the way along. The first drop was awesome; there was a pothole after the second drop that was a bit jarring. Fix that, and I\u2019d have nothing to complain about. I was surprised by the variety in the hills; they don\u2019t just go in descending order. As a result, sometimes I got a big floater hill, other times a speed hill with a quick pop. Some of the hills on the return route were a touch rough, but nothing terrible. On the whole, it may not be in my top 10 overall, but it\u2019s definitely a high-quality wooden coaster. Wolverine Wildcat I knew nothing about this one going in, except that it\u2019s wood and apparently named after two animals (kidding). I was expecting some roughness, but I also noted that the layout seemed similar to Knobels\u2019 Phoenix, so I had a burst of hope going up the lift hill. Going down the first drop, though, I was surprised to feel\u2026nothing. No roughness, but also no sensation of airtime, not even a bump as it bottomed out. I was able to see later that the first chunk of the ride has been replaced with Titan Track. Technically, I\u2019d encountered Titan Track before, on Zambezi Zinger, but that was just the lift. Here, the first half of the ride is Titan, which makes it much smoother. I\u2019d have to say too smooth, in fact. It doesn\u2019t feel like a wood coaster anymore. It doesn\u2019t really feel steel either; it just gives the sense that something\u2019s wrong. Then I got to the second half of the ride, and I wished they\u2019d included more Titan Track. Like most Dinn coasters, this one has aged badly, and the second half was punishing. Unfortunately, it still has a fair bit of speed at that point. I escaped without a headache, but only thanks to the Titan Track. Corkscrew This is one of those cute little Arrow coasters found at parks all over the US. In fact, it\u2019s very possibly the cutest and littlest I\u2019ve ridden. It has no vertical loops, just a couple of corkscrews, and almost nothing else. There\u2019s a moment right after the first drop where I thought \u201cand this is where the loop should be.\u201d The corkscrews were a little janky, but not more than I expected. It\u2019s got enough speed (barely) to take them at a decent clip, so that wasn\u2019t bad. A perfectly fine one-and-done, since I didn\u2019t have to wait too long. Thunderhawk This is one of the infamous Vekoma Suspended Looping Coasters (SLC). I\u2019ve only ridden one before, but this model has a terrible reputation. It\u2019s also way in the back of the park, on the far side of the lake, as if the park is embarrassed by it. But I hiked all the way out there nonetheless, and fortunately, there was no line, as it was successfully running two trains, and the operations were sharp. It still has the older style trains with the headbanger restraints, but I just barely got above them by stretching my neck out. I got thoroughly stapled by the ride op, but who cares, it\u2019s an SLC. The initial drop was smoother than I anticipated, but the transitions are still janky, and there\u2019s little you can do about that. I\u2019ll say this about SLCs: it\u2019s almost impossible to tell where in the layout you are at any given time. As SLCs go, I\u2019d have to pronounce it \u201cnot terrible.\u201d I had a lot of driving left to do that day, and I\u2019d already decided not to ride Zach\u2019s Zoomer, which is one of those kiddie creds that\u2019s almost large enough to be considered. There\u2019s a wild mouse as well, but those tend to attract a line. I saw it on the way out, but quickly dismissed it. So a couple of hours to get four credits, one of them quite good. Not shabby.","title":"Michigan's Adventure"},{"location":"coasters/2023/michigansadventure/#michigans-adventure","text":"Visited: July 28, 2023 Attending: Just Brian I decided that after the conference, I would get a little nuts. If I went straight east from the Dells, I could encounter Michigan\u2019s Adventure and Canada\u2019s Wonderland before turning south to go home, so that was the plan. Unfortunately, the original plan involved crossing Lake Michigan on a ferry, which would save a lot of time, and sounded like fun too. However, the ferry sold out for Friday the 28th before I even left on my trip, so I had to drive south around the bottom of the lake, which took considerably longer. But I still got to Michigan\u2019s Adventure around mid-day. It\u2019s a pleasant small park around a little lake in the middle. It\u2019s smaller even than Dorney or Worlds of Fun, making it the smallest Cedar Fair park I\u2019ve been to. And its coaster collection is similarly small. It has a massive parking lot for some reason, but that gives a lot of space to show off Shivering Timbers, which if nothing else, is extremely photogenic.","title":"Michigan\u2019s Adventure"},{"location":"coasters/2023/michigansadventure/#shivering-timbers","text":"This was my highest priority for this trip, and the ride that Buzzed Bars had enjoyed most during their recent Stumble, so I was optimistic.

I've been planning this since around 2019, when I ended up with a bonus plane ticket. Since then it seemed like the Florida Parks just kept adding more coasters to my list. Originally I wanted to wait until Iron Gwazi was open but with the pandemic and other things going on, I just didn't make it down there. However, with some unexpected unemployment and a plane ticket that I had to use, I decided to spend five days to come down and sweep up all the credits I could, which means trying to visit a lot of parks in not very many days. I was also competing with the various Halloween events that the parks put on, which I have no interest in, but they do draw a crowd. I flew down on Saturday the 9th and while it wasn't a lot of flying, I was a little delayed in Atlanta and I knew that I\u2019d be arriving with very little time to spare in Orlando. SeaWorld Orlando was a park where I only had a handful of credits to get, although they were important ones by my standards. I had picked a hotel by Seaworld because it's centrally located for the Orlando parks, but I also thought that if I needed more than one day at SeaWorld I could go back anytime I wanted to with my season pass. So I picked up my car at the airport, headed directly to SeaWorld, and got there around about 4:00 in the afternoon. I knew that the park would be closing at 7:00 for their Halloween event, which I didn't have a ticket to. What I didn't know was that they would be shutting down the major roller coasters at 5:30 to prep for the event. So I was on a mission. Mako Mako is a coaster I've wanted to ride for a while. I love B&M hypers, and Mako is supposed to be one of the best. I had some doubts, but a lot of people gave the same opinion: that it was pretty much a pinnacle of what a hyper should be, with lots of floater air time, which I love. It's at the back of the park, so I had to hustle to get back there. The line was roughly 20 minutes when I got there, which isn't too bad, but it was awfully humid. Once I got to the station, I decided to get a back row ride if I was only going to get one. Fortunately I didn't have to wait too long to get the back row seat that I wanted. As for the ride itself, I'd have to say it does impress. Like a lot of hyper coasters, 200 feet just doesn't feel all that tall anymore compared to the giga models. However Mako has quality. I enjoyed the first drop quite a bit, and the first turn with the overbank was a lot of fun. The second hill had a ridiculous amount of floater air time. Unfortunately it does turn around at that point, which is a common problem to hypers. I think every hyper coaster probably feels like it could be a bit longer and this is no different. I was expecting some better airtime from the tiny hill right before the mid course but that didn't happen. The bit of turns and fun track that it does after the mid course and before the brakes were a lot more fun than I anticipated, with great views and interesting forces. I'll have to ride it again before I can decide whether it's really the best hyper of all. A front-row ride would also be a good test. Right now it's really good, but I don't know if it's better than Nitro. Pipeline Pipeline was an interesting experiment, if an unplanned one. It's the newest coaster in Orlando and an entirely new type from B&M, a surf coaster. I've ridden stand-up coasters from B&M before; in fact I\u2019ve ridden all of them in the United States, and they range from \u201cjust okay\u201d to actively bad. However I\u2019d heard really good things about the surf coaster design, and while it wasn't something I particularly anticipated, I wanted to see how it would work. Pipeline is certainly eye-catching; it's right in front of the park, and pretty much the only thing you see when you enter. As it happens the entrance to the ride itself is around the back, so you can't go right to it. I got in line around about 5:00, which is when I found out that the rides would be shutting down at 5:30. Although the line was a 60-minute wait, it looked like they were going to let anybody in line finish the ride. As it happens, I think I got the next-to-last train of the day, for which I\u2019m grateful. So was it better than a stand-up coaster? Yes, absolutely. The \u201cseats\u201d are not that different from a stand-up seat, but they have a lot more springiness in the support, which allows you to flex with your knees with the hills. It has the same vest restraint that you find on dive coasters and wing coasters, and that's kind of a bummer. The vest actually cut into my collarbone somewhat uncomfortably. But I'd rather have some pain from the restraints than some pain from the seat. The coaster starts with a launch, not a particularly forceful one, which is sort of the theme for this ride. However it does the trick that recent launch coasters do of rising up or hitting a hill while it's still accelerating, which is an interesting feeling if you don't know it's coming. The first element is sort of a big turnaround, meant to simulate the motions that a surfer would make on the ocean, and in that sense it succeeds. The spring loaded seats go up and down with the air time, which means when you get air, your feet come off the floor. I knew that might happen, but it was still a very strange sensation to just rise up into the air while on a coaster. I guess that's the real definition of \u201cstanding airtime.\u201d It's not a long ride and it's not particularly forceful, but it's not a kiddie ride either. It's fun, it's swoopy, and I think it's supposed to be that way. There are some moments of air that take full advantage of the seat mechanism, and some moments of positive forces as well that push you down. I found myself laughing while I was riding, which is usually a good sign. I had the back row, which was a natural instinct for a first ride but I do wonder what it would be like from the front. It's a shame I didn't have more time because I really think this would benefit from a reride. Ice Breaker This was the only credit I didn't have yet, but I ran out of time. I didn\u2019t even get near the ride, just a view from across the lake.","title":"SeaWorld Orlando"},{"location":"coasters/2023/seaworldorlando/#seaworld-orlando","text":"Visited: September 9, 2023 Attending: Just Brian In September 2023 I finally decided to take a long-delayed trip to Orlando.

It\u2019s a three-hour drive from Kansas City to Branson, but I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s a three-hour drive from anywhere. Branson certainly depicts itself as a tourist town; there were signs advertising cave tours almost from the moment I left Kansas City, and innumerable billboards for various shows once I got closer. It\u2019s a Tourist Trap with two capital T\u2019s. So I was reminded of Pigeon Forge right away. The traffic wasn\u2019t bad until I got to the last few miles, after which it was nearly a dead stop. Although I got there nearly at opening, it was already pretty crowded getting in. I parked close enough that I could feasibly skip the tram, but it was a hike. I pretty much resigned myself to the idea that it was going to be a hot, crowded day. The forecast was in the mid-90s, although I was hoping for a shower to cool things off and clear out the crowd. That didn\u2019t happen, so I just made the best of it. I still had some thought of getting Time Traveler as my #200 credit, so as a result, I made some choices that I normally wouldn\u2019t. Thunderation One of those odd choices was starting with the mine train, even though it was the first thing I came to, and right next to Time Traveler to boot. Then again, mine trains often draw long lines because it\u2019s a family ride, so maybe better to get it out of the way first. I met a nice young person named Casey in the line, along with their mother, so I was at least entertained throughout the wait. The ride is odd, by mine train standards, but everything at SDC is unique somehow, so it seemed fitting. It drops out of the station and makes good use of the terrain, the same area that Time Traveler uses. It\u2019s got some curves, a helix (of course), and a couple of tunnels. Then the lift hill happens at like the 80% mark, after which it does more or less nothing. Mine trains are everywhere, but this is one of the more unusual ones. Outlaw Run Although I knew I was burning daylight, I took a quick walk down to the Grand Exposition section to discover that yes, the coaster there is a real kiddie coaster, and I wasn\u2019t about to ride that just to manipulate a milestone number. So I walked, and walked, and walked over to Outlaw Run, which is a good distance away. I got lost doing that (because I still don\u2019t take printed maps), which allowed me to see that the line for Fire in the Hole was pretty nuts, so I decided I wasn\u2019t going to do that, either. But Outlaw Run is an RMC, and RMCs are consistently good, so no worries. And it is very good, although within the context of RMCs, it\u2019s not top-tier. This is a very early RMC, and one constructed from scratch with topper track, so it\u2019s not quite as wild as later I-box models. It makes excellent use of the terrain, and it\u2019s all back in the woods, so that\u2019s great. It looks like the signature RMC element at the time was the wall stall, because Outlaw Run has a couple, and they\u2019re great. In a lot of ways, it\u2019s a prototype for Lightning Rod. The double barrel roll was the one part I knew about, which actually wasn\u2019t terribly impressive, but I\u2019m sure it was in 2013, on a wooden coaster. So a good ride, definitely re-rideable, but not superlative. Wildfire I then stood in line for Powder Keg for quite some time, but unfortunately it went down as I was literally standing at the air gates. If I hadn\u2019t waited for the back row, or taken the single-rider offer, I might have been stuck on the brakes or the transfer track. Regardless, we all got chased out of the queue, so I went to ride Wildfire, which is nearby. Wildfire is another odd duck, but far from the oddest in the park. It\u2019s a B&M sit-down coaster, which basically means \u201ca B&M floorless, but with a floor.\u201d It\u2019s another terrain coaster, so it\u2019s 120 feet tall with a 155-foot drop. It\u2019s got all the standard elements: an Immelman, a vertical loop, a cobra roll, a corkscrew, and a helix. None of them are particularly unusual, although the views are pretty darned good. It reminds me of Dark Knight at SFNE. It\u2019s fine, it\u2019s a B&M, but again, not superlative. Time Traveler Powder Keg was still closed after I got off Wildfire, so I had a brief look around for lunch options, discovered they were all mobbed, and then decided to bite the bullet and go stand in line for Time Traveler. The line was quite long, probably over an hour, but there was still plenty of queue that went unused, which is impressive. The queue-house is well themed with clocks, steampunk decorations, and other doodads that tell the story of this 19th-century inventor\u2019s attempt at a time machine. And it\u2019s got fans, so that\u2019s a good thing. But the best thing is the soundtrack: on the way in, I realized that I was listening to a bluegrass version of Cyndi Lauper\u2019s \u201cTime After Time,\u201d which amused me. Although it\u2019s harder to hear when the queue is full, I caught Cher\u2019s \u201cIf I Could Turn Back Time\u201d and of course, Pink Floyd\u2019s \u201cTime.\u201d I would absolutely buy the soundtrack to this ride; sadly, it wasn\u2019t for sale anywhere I could find. Eventually, I reached the head of the queue, where the grouper honored my request for row 7, as recommended by Larson (she was going to put me in 6, so it wasn\u2019t a big ask). It\u2019s kinda odd that you get grouped before going up the stairs to the platform, but it makes for a neat reveal. Time Traveler is hard to describe in words, but here goes: each train has four cars, each with two rows of two seated back-to-back, so I was in the last car, facing forward. Each car can rotate freely, not \u201cspin\u201d like a Gerstlauer, but a slow-ish controlled turn, so you never know which way you\u2019ll be facing at any given time. The row 7 recommendation was because the vertical drop happens right out of the station with no lift hill, and the cars start to turn while they\u2019re still in the station, so row 7 is guaranteed to take the drop facing some direction other than forward, usually sideways. Which is the experience that I got, and I admit I grabbed the bar while that was happening. The ride does a loop before the official first launch, where it stops dead for a few seconds before going. Like many others, I wish that was done as a rolling launch, but it is what it is. The second launch is a boost, but that\u2019s not until the ride is nearly over. As for the experience itself, it was confusing, but not nauseating. I didn\u2019t feel comfortable going hands-up too often, but I do remember facing the inside of a big wide curve as we went through it. The terrain where the coaster sits is varied, and I suspect once it becomes more forested, the ride will be even more disorienting. When it was over, I was wondering what had just happened, which is one of the best roller-coaster feelings to have. I wish the day had been less busy, because I absolutely would have gone around again. Powder Keg It was mid-afternoon, it was getting hot, and I was well aware that I was dehydrating. But I had to take a last try at Powder Keg, and to my relief, it was open. There was slightly less queue than my previous wait, so I took a chance and waited for the back row. Powder Keg is possibly the oddest duck in a park full of odd ducks. It started out as a Premier Rides water coaster, but apparently the water features weren\u2019t working out right, and they got S&S to convert it into a compressed-air launch. I had no clue which parts of this used to be in the water; there was no way for me to tell. After the strange restraints are locked, you roll out onto a transfer track, which carries you up the hill to the launch section (which is apparently prone to breakdowns). Then there\u2019s a reasonably forceful launch, followed by a couple of big elements, after which, it turns into a terrain coaster, like just about everything else in this park. Then there\u2019s an unexpected lift hill, a little drop, a turn, and back to the station. I guess it makes sense, when most of the ride is down in the valley, you have to get back up somehow, but it feels weird, just like it does on the mine train. As it is, I really have no idea whether I liked it or not. And then, although it was midafternoon, I bailed. I had a three-hour drive in front of me, and my flight the next morning was absurdly early. I hiked back out across the scorching parking lot, left Branson, and then stopped at the first fast food place I could find. On the whole, the experience was strange. SDC is a carefully crafted, well maintained park in a town that\u2019s deliberately a cheesy tourist mecca. That seems unique, but Pigeon Forge is the same. Even though there were fewer coasters than Worlds of Fun, these were much more memorable, and of better quality. I\u2019d happily go back there again, preferably on a lighter day, but I have no idea when I\u2019ll have the opportunity.","title":"Silver Dollar City"},{"location":"coasters/2023/silverdollarcity/#silver-dollar-city","text":"Visited: June 24, 2023 Attending: Just Brian If Worlds of Fun had been a drop-in, Silver Dollar City was a plan. It\u2019s a three-hour drive from Kansas City to Branson, but I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s a three-hour drive from anywhere. Branson certainly depicts itself as a tourist town; there were signs advertising cave tours almost from the moment I left Kansas City, and innumerable billboards for various shows once I got closer. It\u2019s a Tourist Trap with two capital T\u2019s. So I was reminded of Pigeon Forge right away. The traffic wasn\u2019t bad until I got to the last few miles, after which it was nearly a dead stop. Although I got there nearly at opening, it was already pretty crowded getting in. I parked close enough that I could feasibly skip the tram, but it was a hike. I pretty much resigned myself to the idea that it was going to be a hot, crowded day. The forecast was in the mid-90s, although I was hoping for a shower to cool things off and clear out the crowd. That didn\u2019t happen, so I just made the best of it. I still had some thought of getting Time Traveler as my #200 credit, so as a result, I made some choices that I normally wouldn\u2019t.","title":"Silver Dollar City"},{"location":"coasters/2023/silverdollarcity/#thunderation","text":"One of those odd choices was starting with the mine train, even though it was the first thing I came to, and right next to Time Traveler to boot. Then again, mine trains often draw long lines because it\u2019s a family ride, so maybe better to get it out of the way first. I met a nice young person named Casey in the line, along with their mother, so I was at least entertained throughout the wait. The ride is odd, by mine train standards, but everything at SDC is unique somehow, so it seemed fitting. It drops out of the station and makes good use of the terrain, the same area that Time Traveler uses. It\u2019s got some curves, a helix (of course), and a couple of tunnels. Then the lift hill happens at like the 80% mark, after which it does more or less nothing. Mine trains are everywhere, but this is one of the more unusual ones.","title":"Thunderation"},{"location":"coasters/2023/silverdollarcity/#outlaw-run","text":"Although I knew I was burning daylight, I took a quick walk down to the Grand Exposition section to discover that yes, the coaster there is a real kiddie coaster, and I wasn\u2019t about to ride that just to manipulate a milestone number. So I walked, and walked, and walked over to Outlaw Run, which is a good distance away. I got lost doing that (because I still don\u2019t take printed maps), which allowed me to see that the line for Fire in the Hole was pretty nuts, so I decided I wasn\u2019t going to do that, either. But Outlaw Run is an RMC, and RMCs are consistently good, so no worries. And it is very good, although within the context of RMCs, it\u2019s not top-tier. This is a very early RMC, and one constructed from scratch with topper track, so it\u2019s not quite as wild as later I-box models. It makes excellent use of the terrain, and it\u2019s all back in the woods, so that\u2019s great. It looks like the signature RMC element at the time was the wall stall, because Outlaw Run has a couple, and they\u2019re great. In a lot of ways, it\u2019s a prototype for Lightning Rod. The double barrel roll was the one part I knew about, which actually wasn\u2019t terribly impressive, but I\u2019m sure it was in 2013, on a wooden coaster. So a good ride, definitely re-rideable, but not superlative.","title":"Outlaw Run"},{"location":"coasters/2023/silverdollarcity/#wildfire","text":"I then stood in line for Powder Keg for quite some time, but unfortunately it went down as I was literally standing at the air gates. If I hadn\u2019t waited for the back row, or taken the single-rider offer, I might have been stuck on the brakes or the transfer track. Regardless, we all got chased out of the queue, so I went to ride Wildfire, which is nearby. Wildfire is another odd duck, but far from the oddest in the park. It\u2019s a B&M sit-down coaster, which basically means \u201ca B&M floorless, but with a floor.\u201d It\u2019s another terrain coaster, so it\u2019s 120 feet tall with a 155-foot drop. It\u2019s got all the standard elements: an Immelman, a vertical loop, a cobra roll, a corkscrew, and a helix. None of them are particularly unusual, although the views are pretty darned good. It reminds me of Dark Knight at SFNE. It\u2019s fine, it\u2019s a B&M, but again, not superlative.","title":"Wildfire"},{"location":"coasters/2023/silverdollarcity/#time-traveler","text":"Powder Keg was still closed after I got off Wildfire, so I had a brief look around for lunch options, discovered they were all mobbed, and then decided to bite the bullet and go stand in line for Time Traveler. The line was quite long, probably over an hour, but there was still plenty of queue that went unused, which is impressive. The queue-house is well themed with clocks, steampunk decorations, and other doodads that tell the story of this 19th-century inventor\u2019s attempt at a time machine. And it\u2019s got fans, so that\u2019s a good thing. But the best thing is the soundtrack: on the way in, I realized that I was listening to a bluegrass version of Cyndi Lauper\u2019s \u201cTime After Time,\u201d which amused me. Although it\u2019s harder to hear when the queue is full, I caught Cher\u2019s \u201cIf I Could Turn Back Time\u201d and of course, Pink Floyd\u2019s \u201cTime.\u201d I would absolutely buy the soundtrack to this ride; sadly, it wasn\u2019t for sale anywhere I could find. Eventually, I reached the head of the queue, where the grouper honored my request for row 7, as recommended by Larson (she was going to put me in 6, so it wasn\u2019t a big ask). It\u2019s kinda odd that you get grouped before going up the stairs to the platform, but it makes for a neat reveal. Time Traveler is hard to describe in words, but here goes: each train has four cars, each with two rows of two seated back-to-back, so I was in the last car, facing forward. Each car can rotate freely, not \u201cspin\u201d like a Gerstlauer, but a slow-ish controlled turn, so you never know which way you\u2019ll be facing at any given time. The row 7 recommendation was because the vertical drop happens right out of the station with no lift hill, and the cars start to turn while they\u2019re still in the station, so row 7 is guaranteed to take the drop facing some direction other than forward, usually sideways. Which is the experience that I got, and I admit I grabbed the bar while that was happening. The ride does a loop before the official first launch, where it stops dead for a few seconds before going. Like many others, I wish that was done as a rolling launch, but it is what it is. The second launch is a boost, but that\u2019s not until the ride is nearly over. As for the experience itself, it was confusing, but not nauseating. I didn\u2019t feel comfortable going hands-up too often, but I do remember facing the inside of a big wide curve as we went through it. The terrain where the coaster sits is varied, and I suspect once it becomes more forested, the ride will be even more disorienting. When it was over, I was wondering what had just happened, which is one of the best roller-coaster feelings to have. I wish the day had been less busy, because I absolutely would have gone around again.","title":"Time Traveler"},{"location":"coasters/2023/silverdollarcity/#powder-keg","text":"It was mid-afternoon, it was getting hot, and I was well aware that I was dehydrating.

In retrospect, I think I spent a lot longer in lines than I might tolerate now. I also left a few credits behind because of lack of time. I knew this trip would be a short one, and that was fine. My priority was getting to Wisconsin, and given how late I\u2019d gotten in the previous night, I wasn\u2019t taking chances today. I got there about 15 minutes before open, got a good parking space, and prepared to be efficient. Maxx Force I\u2019d ridden Maxx Force on my last trip, and waited a good while to do so. Although it\u2019s generally not my policy to go on the coaster near the front of the park first, on the advice of Buzzed Bars (that it always has a line, and frequently breaks down), I decided to amend my policy. Which proved to be smart. I had to wait on the midway until the ride itself opened, but my total wait was maybe 20 minutes. I got assigned to the next-to-last row, which would normally be my preference, but I don\u2019t think it really matters with this one. The launch was strong, but not as strong as I remembered. The force definitely dropped before the \u201cstep up\u201d on the launch track. A couple of elements, and then it\u2019s done. Sitting in the back just emphasizes the brakes on the final down-slope, where brakes shouldn\u2019t be. I stand by my assertion that this is a good half-a-ride. Maybe I won\u2019t prioritize this in the future. Trivia: By riding Steel Curtain, then Maxx Force, I rode two S&S coasters in succession, which is unusual, because they\u2019re kinda rare. I could have gone for three by riding Joker next, but I didn\u2019t. Whizzer Whizzer is a nice historic Schwarzkopf that opened with the park in 1976. It\u2019s got a clone at California\u2019s Great America, and used to have a sibling at Worlds of Fun. I missed this on my last trip because, stupidly, I just forgot it was there. I became much more interested in this ride after riding Zambezi Zinger, which was \u201cinspired\u201d by the former coaster at Worlds of Fun. This one has bobsled-shaped trains, kinda similar to Space Mountain in Florida, in that you ride in a single-file line, either one or two people per slot. Fortunately, I was alone, which made for a nice, open experience. The spiral lift is still pretty neat, but might have been a lot cooler if I hadn\u2019t just done one last month. The ride itself isn\u2019t strongly forceful, but it does have some nice swooping effects, and a helix that will push you back into your seat. Really not bad for such an old coaster. I hope they continue to maintain this one. The Dark Knight I skipped this ride last time I was here, and with good reason: it\u2019s a clone. Not a super-successful clone, though. This one and the one at Great Adventure opened at the same time, and there was supposed to be a third in New England, but they broke some zoning laws, and it got shipped to Mexico instead of opening. Anyway, I\u2019d ridden one before, and they\u2019re kinda dull. It\u2019s also family-friendly, so it attracts a long line. Which I anticipated, but I decided to get the credit anyway.

However, I eventually got through the door\u2026at which point I discovered I didn\u2019t know just how much queue there is. I remember cruising through most of it at Great Adventure, so it must not have registered, but this thing goes on forever. When I finally got to ride\u2026well, it\u2019s a wild mouse in a box, so there\u2019s not much to say about that. The person riding with me had clearly never experienced one before, so he was startled by the switchbacks, and the drops, and everything, I guess. So good for him. The train jump-scare at the end wasn\u2019t nearly as loud or bright as I remember, so maybe they turned that down. I\u2019m certainly not about to ride this again. Maybe the Great Adventure version, if it\u2019s on a slow day. Goliath I decided to just skip Joker altogether, even though I still need the credit. The line was long, and I just don\u2019t like S&S Free Spins, although I\u2019ve only been on one. So I moved clockwise back around the outside of the park. Demon and American Eagle were both closed for the day, but that was OK by me. Goliath was the first one I came to, and I know it has a secret single-rider entrance, so I went right there, and was on the platform almost immediately. However, once there, I was at the whim of the grouper, so I had to wait a while. I got assigned to row 11, which would have been my choice, so that made me happy. Last time, I was somewhat disappointed by Goliath, as compared to other RMC\u2019s. This time, with my expectations lowered, I wasn\u2019t expecting big air or fancy inversions, and I liked it better. The first drop is excellent, as is the dive loop near the end. And the stall, of course, is pure poetry. It\u2019s short, unfortunately, but it\u2019s still probably the best ride in the park. After that, I wanted to tag the B&Ms if I could. Unfortunately, X-Flight had quite the line. I figured Raging Bull would be doable, because B&M hypers never seem to get enough love, and this one is pretty hidden. I was wrong about that, though; the line was nearly onto the midway. I figured I\u2019d exhausted my opportunities, and just left. I had thought about going to Little Amerricka, as it was on my way to the hotel, but I couldn\u2019t see taking the time just to get myself beat up by a Chance toboggan, even if it happened to be running, so I didn\u2019t.","title":"Six Flags Great America"},{"location":"coasters/2023/sixflagsgreatamerica/#six-flags-great-america","text":"Visited: July 23, 2023 Attending: Just Brian I did Great America on my previous Wisconsin trip, and I remember really liking it.

Which is great, because Magic Mountain is a massive park with a lot for enthusiasts to do. Most of the club got up early, had some breakfast at the Hampton Inn, and headed over to the park for our early admission\u2026and then waited in line at the parking gate, because there was some sort of communications mix-up, and they didn\u2019t know how early we were coming. It was a gorgeous day with a crystal-blue sky, so many of us took advantage of the opportunity to get photos of X2, because the best place to photograph that ride is from outside the park. Eventually they let us in, we did the long hike up from the parking lot, and then stood around some more at the entrance while we got our lanyards organized, but it was worth it, because we were promised some sweet ERT. West Coast Racers We were hoping for ERT on X2, so of course it wasn\u2019t running right away. But West Coast Racers was, which makes a reasonable backup. Some folks hadn\u2019t been to Magic Mountain in a few years, so Racers was a +1 for them. We zipped through the queue, which was kind of a shame because it\u2019s nicely themed\u2026but I don\u2019t think anybody really cared all that much. Racers is a tricky ride to evaluate, because it\u2019s fairly unique. It\u2019s not very tall, and the two individual sides aren\u2019t all that long. There\u2019s not much airtime, just a little pop right at the start. The launches aren\u2019t particularly forceful; they\u2019re just normal Premiere launches, although I like the second one. The thing about Racers is, well, the racing. If you\u2019ve got friends on the other train, you\u2019ll have fun waving at them, especially on the helixes. And since Buzzed Bars were basically the only people there, there was a lot of taunting. And a lot of mocking of the comfort collars, because they\u2019re totally unneeded. I\u2019m pretty sure I went around once with Eric, and maybe a second time? Not exactly sure. This is one of those where you just do it for fun, not for the coaster itself. Apocalypse Apocalypse was the only other thing that was open at that particular moment, and it\u2019s right nearby, so some of us popped over there. Not really enough to fill a train, but some of us. Mostly we talked about whether we\u2019d ridden it before, and what we thought of it at the time. Because I don\u2019t think much of anybody rides this anymore. I liked it when it was new, because GCI twister models were a new thing, but this one really isn\u2019t the best. It doesn\u2019t have much in the way of drops, so it doesn\u2019t carry enough speed to make the twisters worthwhile, at least not in the morning when it\u2019s running cold. So we rode it, and that was about all, because we quickly got the call to head to\u2026 X2 We had a fair number of folks who\u2019d never been to Magic Mountain before, and X2 was probably the top of their list of rides to experience (with a couple of close seconds we\u2019ll get to). Grabbing some remaining ERT with X2 open was a real thrill for them. For all of us, really, because I don\u2019t get to ride X2 very often. As I\u2019d promised long ago, I rode with Bryant, back car, left side. I let him have the inside, because that\u2019s usually preferable. I particularly enjoyed the view from the lift, because it was a gorgeous, clear day. I believe it was running fairly well, possibly a little slower than I\u2019d experienced in the past; I\u2019d never ridden it at the start of the day before. I was particularly pleased that I remembered to brace myself on the final raven turn, and therefore didn\u2019t suffer the whack to the back of the head that I\u2019d experienced before. Bryant was thrilled with the whole experience, and wanted to immediately go again from the front. Personally, I haven\u2019t found the front row to be all that much different; the sensation of dropping face-first that I always expect just hasn\u2019t been there. I opted for another back-row ride, this time on the inside. Oddly, during the flip just before the drop, I did get a straight-down view this time that sticks in my memory. I\u2019m not sure how I\u2019d never noticed before. After successfully navigating the raven turn again, I figured I\u2019d probably pushed my luck sufficiently, and I decided to relinquish the back row to other folks who hadn\u2019t had the chance before. The club members reacted as I\u2019d hoped they would, mostly with expressions of shock and awe. I learned this time around that if you tuck your head down just before the last raven turn, you can avoid the head-whacking that I\u2019d experienced before. X2 provides some reasons to be cautious, so it\u2019s not at the very top of my list, but it did jump up a few notches with this reride. Backstage tour At this point we headed over toward the Gotham City section of the park for our next big treat: a backstage tour with the head of the coaster maintenance department. Maybe not so much \u201cbackstage tour,\u201d but a good look around the \u201ccycle shop,\u201d which is apparently where they refurbish trains. There was a brand-new train for Full Throttle, fresh off the boat and still undergoing its initial inspection. There was also a B&M train from Scream with all the cars completely separated. Although they told us that B&M trains are easy to maintain, it looked like this one had accumulated a lot of crud. There was also one of the cars from Superman, which was getting a tune-up before going back onto the track facing backwards, which was a neat little preview. They let us take as many photos as we wanted, and the maintenance lead was happy to tell stories and answer some questions that got progressively more detailed. It doesn\u2019t get much more enthusiast than that, so most of us enjoyed it immensely. We even took advantage of the opportunity to hang around outside the shed and get photos from angles that are normally unavailable to the public. One unfortunate thing we learned was that Twisted Colossus was down, and expected to be so for several days. Since we heard that from the most reliable source, we had no reason to doubt it, but it was kind of a bummer. Wonder Woman Once we exited the backstage area, we were very close to Wonder Woman. For those of us who\u2019d been to Magic Mountain before, this was a +1 that we needed to get. There was a good bit of anticipation around this one, as some of us had ridden Jersey Devil, others had ridden the various small raptors, and some of us none at all, so there was a wide range of experience. Personally, I didn\u2019t expect much. Jersey Devil is decent, especially when it\u2019s running fast, but it\u2019s in the lower tier of RMCs. I also didn\u2019t think much of the claim that Wonder Woman is taller and longer than Jersey Devil, because it\u2019s only the orientation of the station that makes it longer. Except oops, I was wrong about that. The extra curve to get back to the station is a long, sweeping banked curve over the entrance plaza, which is really a lot cooler than the Jersey Devil version. Other than that, the two rides are fundamentally the same, down to the slightly uncomfortable trains. The club took advantage of the theme to have an \u201call women\u201d ride, which I thought was great, and a \u201cbig guys\u201d ride to maximize the weight of the train. I didn\u2019t qualify for either, but it looked like everybody had fun. After that, we headed over to the picnic area near the entrance for lunch provided by the park. It was nice, but probably the least popular of the perks we were treated to. Superman Escape from Krypton After lunch, I headed over to Superman with Larson, Blake, and a few other folks. I didn\u2019t have a huge love for Superman last time I rode it, but it is a milestone coaster, and specifically, only the left side was open. (We\u2019d just seen the right-side car up on blocks, after all.) Even better, the left side was running facing forward, which I hadn\u2019t experienced before. By at least a couple of standards, I could count that as a new credit, but I choose not to. The queue took nearly forever, because Superman isn\u2019t an easy ride for ops, but also there seemed to be an unusual number of oversized guests who needed to do the walk of shame. I ended up in the back row, not that it really mattered. The launch isn\u2019t terribly forceful, because of the LIMs, but it is long, and eventually you\u2019re going pretty fast. The forwards experience was\u2026fine. Facing forward, you can see just how far up the tower you don\u2019t go, which was considerable. I doubt we crossed the 300-foot mark. I very much prefer the backward view. That was interesting to have done, but I have no need to go around again. Ninja Blake hadn\u2019t been on Ninja before, and he wanted the credit, so I offered to go over there with him and Carl. It was far enough into the afternoon that crowds had started to arrive. Ninja is another ops-intensive ride, and it caters to families, so the line was fairly long. It was a bit more fun than I remembered, but not a ton. It\u2019s better by far than Iron Dragon, but a shade below the Bat. Really, I can take or leave these Arrow suspended guys, so I probably won\u2019t do it again for a while. Tatsu After that, I kinda did nothing for a while. There was chatter in the Discord about meeting up for Tatsu, so I went there, but it took a very long time for anybody to get their act together, so I ended up just kind of chilling for quite some time. Eventually we got a quorum and rode. There\u2019s a secret single-rider line that cuts off a lot of the wait time, so we took advantage of that. Somehow I ended up in the back row even as a single-rider; not sure how that happened. I tried to make sure I spent my time looking down rather than forward, so I could enjoy the views, which mostly worked. It was JohnMike\u2019s 300th coaster, so that was a cool thing as well. The park closed fairly early for a Saturday; it was February, after all. But no big deal, because we knew we\u2019d be back the next day. I got some fast food, headed back to the hotel, and passed out. Most of the crew stayed up drinking, but I was unaccountably tired for some reason.","title":"Six Flags Magic Mountain"},{"location":"coasters/2023/sixflagsmagicmountain1/#six-flags-magic-mountain","text":"Visited: February 11, 2023 Attending: Brian, Buzzed Bars Coaster Club Attending a Stumble is always a special experience, and this one was the biggest Stumble yet, with over 100 members attending. Which is great, because Magic Mountain is a massive park with a lot for enthusiasts to do. Most of the club got up early, had some breakfast at the Hampton Inn, and headed over to the park for our early admission\u2026and then waited in line at the parking gate, because there was some sort of communications mix-up, and they didn\u2019t know how early we were coming. It was a gorgeous day with a crystal-blue sky, so many of us took advantage of the opportunity to get photos of X2, because the best place to photograph that ride is from outside the park. Eventually they let us in, we did the long hike up from the parking lot, and then stood around some more at the entrance while we got our lanyards organized, but it was worth it, because we were promised some sweet ERT.","title":"Six Flags Magic Mountain"},{"location":"coasters/2023/sixflagsmagicmountain1/#west-coast-racers","text":"We were hoping for ERT on X2, so of course it wasn\u2019t running right away. But West Coast Racers was, which makes a reasonable backup. Some folks hadn\u2019t been to Magic Mountain in a few years, so Racers was a +1 for them. We zipped through the queue, which was kind of a shame because it\u2019s nicely themed\u2026but I don\u2019t think anybody really cared all that much. Racers is a tricky ride to evaluate, because it\u2019s fairly unique. It\u2019s not very tall, and the two individual sides aren\u2019t all that long. There\u2019s not much airtime, just a little pop right at the start. The launches aren\u2019t particularly forceful; they\u2019re just normal Premiere launches, although I like the second one. The thing about Racers is, well, the racing. If you\u2019ve got friends on the other train, you\u2019ll have fun waving at them, especially on the helixes. And since Buzzed Bars were basically the only people there, there was a lot of taunting. And a lot of mocking of the comfort collars, because they\u2019re totally unneeded. I\u2019m pretty sure I went around once with Eric, and maybe a second time? Not exactly sure. This is one of those where you just do it for fun, not for the coaster itself.","title":"West Coast Racers"},{"location":"coasters/2023/sixflagsmagicmountain1/#apocalypse","text":"Apocalypse was the only other thing that was open at that particular moment, and it\u2019s right nearby, so some of us popped over there. Not really enough to fill a train, but some of us. Mostly we talked about whether we\u2019d ridden it before, and what we thought of it at the time. Because I don\u2019t think much of anybody rides this anymore. I liked it when it was new, because GCI twister models were a new thing, but this one really isn\u2019t the best. It doesn\u2019t have much in the way of drops, so it doesn\u2019t carry enough speed to make the twisters worthwhile, at least not in the morning when it\u2019s running cold. So we rode it, and that was about all, because we quickly got the call to head to\u2026","title":"Apocalypse"},{"location":"coasters/2023/sixflagsmagicmountain1/#x2","text":"We had a fair number of folks who\u2019d never been to Magic Mountain before, and X2 was probably the top of their list of rides to experience (with a couple of close seconds we\u2019ll get to). Grabbing some remaining ERT with X2 open was a real thrill for them. For all of us, really, because I don\u2019t get to ride X2 very often. As I\u2019d promised long ago, I rode with Bryant, back car, left side. I let him have the inside, because that\u2019s usually preferable. I particularly enjoyed the view from the lift, because it was a gorgeous, clear day. I believe it was running fairly well, possibly a little slower than I\u2019d experienced in the past; I\u2019d never ridden it at the start of the day before. I was particularly pleased that I remembered to brace myself on the final raven turn, and therefore didn\u2019t suffer the whack to the back of the head that I\u2019d experienced before. Bryant was thrilled with the whole experience, and wanted to immediately go again from the front. Personally, I haven\u2019t found the front row to be all that much different; the sensation of dropping face-first that I always expect just hasn\u2019t been there. I opted for another back-row ride, this time on the inside. Oddly, during the flip just before the drop, I did get a straight-down view this time that sticks in my memory. I\u2019m not sure how I\u2019d never noticed before. After successfully navigating the raven turn again, I figured I\u2019d probably pushed my luck sufficiently, and I decided to relinquish the back row to other folks who hadn\u2019t had the chance before. The club members reacted as I\u2019d hoped they would, mostly with expressions of shock and awe. I learned this time around that if you tuck your head down just before the last raven turn, you can avoid the head-whacking that I\u2019d experienced before. X2 provides some reasons to be cautious, so it\u2019s not at the very top of my list, but it did jump up a few notches with this reride.","title":"X2"},{"location":"coasters/2023/sixflagsmagicmountain1/#backstage-tour","text":"At this point we headed over toward the Gotham City section of the park for our next big treat: a backstage tour with the head of the coaster maintenance department.

There was a brand-new train for Full Throttle, fresh off the boat and still undergoing its initial inspection. There was also a B&M train from Scream with all the cars completely separated.

Full Throttle I believe the original plan for the ERT was for Twisted Colossus, Wonder Woman, and possibly Scream? I\u2019m not sure.

As the most extreme ride available to us, most of us flocked over there right away. I\u2019m not quite sure why, but the ride ops on Full Throttle seem to be encouraged to have some fun with the patrons, and this one certainly did: teasing the folks in football jerseys, launching at unexpected moments, that sort of thing.

Once they announced that we could go ride, there was an actual sprint to the entrance, which was captured on video. By this point, the ERT was officially over, but as we\u2019d all swarmed the ride together, it was more or less an unofficial takeover, except for a couple of families who got caught up in the flow, and were possibly very confused.

They were new parks for me, sort of, but they're still amusement parks of the sort that I'm accustomed to. Disney, and by extension Universal, are expert-level theme parks. They require extra planning, and you have to anticipate bigger crowds. I knew I was coming during what supposed to be the off season, and I planned reasonably well, but I was doing this solo, so I knew that there might be some complications that I missed. Nevertheless I planned my morning out properly, allowed plenty of time, arrived at the parking facility around 8:40, and was rewarded with a truly amazing parking spot. It was just luck of the draw, but I ended up just a couple of slots from the front of the parking structure. From there, it was a couple of escalators, some long paths, a complicated security process that I did not remember from last time, and then a decent hike through the Universal Citywalk to get to the park. Fortunately electronic admission was no problem and I soon found myself at the edge of the lake. It wasn't nine yet, so those of us without special permissions were standing around waiting to be let into the rest of the park. And there were more people than I hoped to see. It probably was an off-season crowd, but it certainly wasn't a ghost town. My plan was to get to Hagrid\u2019s first thing. Unfortunately, everyone else had the same plan, and the stated wait time was about 100 minutes when I arrived. The stated wait time for Velocicoaster, however, was given at 15 minutes. So when I got to the appropriate fork in the path, I made a game-time decision, and headed into Jurassic World to ride the brand-new coaster. Velocicoaster I arrived at Velocicoaster over the bridge behind Hogwarts with the big black netting over top, which I'd seen in many photos and videos before now. I also had a pretty good idea of what the entrance looks like. Fortunately the crowd really was very sparse at this point. The single-rider line wasn't operating at this point because it didn't really need to. So I just joined the general queue, and really bypassed most of the pre-show activities, because there was nobody waiting. As a result, I screwed up the locker system, and locked my little temporary pass card inside the locker. Regardless I was up on the platform almost before I knew it. Which is kind of a shame because it's got a pretty good pre-show, but I figured I could see that later. I strapped myself in, noticed the comfortable restraints, and the comfortable seat as well. The train rolled out, hit its first launch, and soon I was zooming all around a velociraptor paddock. The track goes in and out of the rock work, pretty much as I expected. It feels like close shaves, but of course it isn't really. There were some noises around, but I had difficulty focusing on anything in particular this first time through. I did notice a similarity to Taron, which is another coaster that I've never been on, but I know what it looks like, and it's compared frequently to Velocicoaster. Then the second half kicked in, with a second big launch, the top hat, and then big old swoops around the rest of the area. There's a stall over the path that went on a little bit longer than I expected. I had a pretty good idea what it was going to do next because I'd seen it while I was walking up to the coaster. Then there's the mosasaurus roll at the end. This is one case where I wish I hadn't known. I knew it was coming, I knew other people regarded it as life-changing, so I wasn't really certain what was going to happen. It's a zero-g roll, it's a very good one, and it's over water, but I don't think that it rewrites the book on coasters. It's a good ride, probably an excellent ride, it does many of the things that Intamin does best. I'm just not sure that it's as breathtaking as Iron Gwazi was yesterday. And specifically it didn't do anything I didn't expect, which is kind of my fault for knowing so much about it in advance. But there was nothing so stand-out that it blew me away. It did everything that I thought it would do, and did it really well, but that's all that it did. It did occur to me that a first ride of the day might have been slow, and also that a night ride must be magnificent. Sadly I wouldn't have time for that. Forbidden Journey With Velocicoaster out of the way, my biggest time concern of the day, I headed back over to Hagrid's. The wait time was now 110 minutes, and the single rider line was still closed. I asked the greeter when it might be open, and of course they couldn't tell me. I really didn't want to stand around for two hours, so I went over to Hogwarts to ride the Forbidden Journey, and also get a pretty good look at Hogsmeade, which I hadn't had a chance to do to the level I wanted to in 2011. I noticed a lot of things, and I took an awful lot of pictures, which I didn't do 12 years ago for some reason. I'd already stood through the Forbidden Journey line once before, so I had no hesitation about taking the single rider line this time. In fact the crowd was small enough that single rider deposited me pretty much on the platform right away. I only had to wait a few seconds before there was a party of three to join. The ride is still very impressive, much like I remember it from last time, but it doesn't have the element of surprise anymore. The video sections were a bit more immersive than I remember, and once again I had absolutely no idea where I was in the show building, which is definitely a good thing. On the whole it was a good diversion and I didn't really spend very much time on it. Hagrid's Magical Creatures Motorbike Adventure I came back over to Hagrid's after what felt like only a few minutes, to find that the single rider line was now open. The displayed wait time was still around 100 minutes, and the greeter made a point of telling me that the single rider line would have just as long of a wait. Well, I certainly had to do a good bit of walking to get to the queue building. However once I was inside, the single rider line certainly was only a few minutes long. In fact I was at the front of it before I even knew what was happening. I did get assigned to join a family of five, which is pretty much the point of a single rider line. However, that meant I knew I wouldn't get to sit where I wanted in the train, and specifically I had to occupy the sidecar rather than the motorcycle. The difference wasn't nearly as stark as I thought it would be. I still think I got the full experience from sitting in the sidecar. Would I like to try the motorcycle sometime in the future? Sure, but I don't feel like I missed out badly. Once again, although I tried to avoid spoilers for this ride, I did have some idea of what was going to happen. I had forgotten that the track ends and the train proceeds backwards for a bit. I also had no idea how long the backward section actually was. So that was a nice surprise. I was expecting to stop to see plot-based presentations, so that didn't disappoint me. I even had a pretty good idea of what those presentations would be, since I'm familiar with the story and with the rules of narrative in general. I did think the ride had some pretty good speed at ground level, which makes it seem faster. It dodged around and about in roughly the way that I expected. I was completely aware in advance of the drop track, and although I didn't know exactly where it was, I could guess pretty well, so it didn't surprise me at all. My temporary family didn't know about the drop track, or at least the kids didn't, so they were pretty well surprised. Since I have now done three separate rides with drop tracks, I can say this one was not particularly scary. It's not that far and I could see where it was going. I was surprised by one particular plot point near the end, which I won't spoil. But much like the previous coaster today, it mostly did what I thought it was going to do. It's very impressive, and I thought it did its job very well, but it didn't surprise me in the way that I hoped it would. It's a good ride, but I have to admit that I kind of wish Dueling Dragons could still be there instead. Velocicoaster (again) So at this point, I'd ridden three rides, and it wasn't even 10:00 yet. More important, I had knocked out my two primary goals. I really hadn't known how long that would take, so I found myself at a bit of a loose end. I wandered around Hogsmeade a little bit more, taking pictures, and sharing them with Carole and Alex. But there's not a whole lot more to do in the Wizarding World, so eventually I went back to Jurassic Park. I spent a little time resting in the shade and exchanging texts with Alex. But eventually I decided to go back to Velocicoaster. The line was longer this time, more like 20 minutes, but that was fine with me because I wanted to take the opportunity to see the pre-show that I missed earlier. It's pretty good, about what I would expect, and the velociraptor animatronics are very impressive. With experience, I managed to use the lockers correctly this time. Once I got to the platform, I was assigned a row in the middle of the train, as opposed to closer to the front. I do wish I'd gotten a back-row ride, but that's something for the future. The first unusual thing that happened is that we were removed from the train after sitting down. There was some sort of an issue, which caused them to empty all the trains and cycle them once, empty. Whatever the problem was I had no idea, it didn't seem to affect anything, and we got back on our train once it came around again. This time around I was able to pay a bit more attention in the velociraptor paddock, so I was able to see the model dinosaurs as they were threatening us. That did improve the ride somewhat. As for the rest of it, I took another good look around from the peak of the top hat, and it's a nice view but nothing spectacular. I knew to anticipate the stall, so I didn't grab on the way I had the first time, and I did the same thing through the mosasaurus roll as well. I did feel a greater degree of freedom, but it didn't have that amazing edge that I was hoping it would have. So a little better the second time around, but I don't know that it's automatically top 10 material. Lunch After the second time through, with the single rider line closed again, I didn't feel like I needed to spend the time in the queue again. So I walked through a lot of the Jurassic World store and theming, which was extremely impressive, seeming like it was right out of the movie. I didn't particularly want to pay lunchtime prices at the sit-down restaurant, but I did go outside and find a pizza stand right nearby. It was still relatively early, and there was a picnic area nearby in the shade, relatively empty, so I decided I'd take care of that errand right away. The pizza was fine, nothing in particular to write home about, and of course overpriced. But I was able to hydrate, and that's the important thing. Walking Having accomplished most of the \u201cright half\u201d of the park, I figured I should at least do a full circle around the lake once. So I walked by Kong, and decided not to do that. I walked through the very strange comic-strip themed area, and got lost. I still don't understand this area. I'm one of the older people who might be attending this park, and this particular property seems old even to me. So I just got through it and down to Marvel Superhero island, where I am quite familiar with the properties involved. I spent quite a bit of time in a few stores, looking for something that Alex or Jude might appreciate, but I came up a little bit short. The items are very Avengers-centric, which I really should have expected given the parameters of the contract. However the signage and the rides outside make use of a broader range of characters, so I forgot that they wouldn't all be represented in merchandise. I was particularly disappointed by the lack of Squirrel Girl, which caused me to realize that there weren't going to be any deep cuts here. Spider-Man The Spider-Man dark ride is one that I experienced last time I was here, but I did it in kind of a hurry. I had an express pass at the time, and very little time, so I rushed through the queue and rode it. So I decided to go with the general populace this time, partially because it was still early and I had nothing better to do, partially because it was inside and air-conditioned, and partially to see what I'd missed before. The pre-show is animated, and uses a lot of art style from what looks like a very \u201890s cartoon. Maybe that's intentional, because the '90s Spider-Man cartoon was very popular, but the crude animation and the style of writing are both very over the top. It was probably appropriate when the ride was created, but now that we've had 15 years of Marvel movies taking these characters very seriously, something like this show seems a bit like mockery. The ride itself is pretty good, and much like last time, I would have liked it much better if the Forbidden Journey wasn't a thing that exists. It's a first-rate dark ride that's also the second best dark ride in the park. The plot is still extremely silly and while there are some very nice set pieces, and a very dramatic ending, it's not particularly groundbreaking. Still, I got what I wanted out of it. Incredible Hulk Hulk was another roller coaster that I remember from my previous visit in 2011. I wasn't much of an enthusiast then, but I do remember liking it. I know that it's been completely re-tracked since then, and the pre-show was rebuilt, so I was interested to see what was going on. I did learn that I was going to have to use a locker and empty my pockets thoroughly for all rides, not just Velocicoaster. Once I got inside there wasn't much time to appreciate the pre-show; I was on the platform and on the train almost immediately. The launch tunnel was more impressive than I remember, and the launch itself may have been a bit more forceful than I remember. Unfortunately, the ride doesn't seem to be smoother than I remember. In fact it's a lot worse. I've never been one to complain about the B&M rattle, although other enthusiasts complain about it a lot. On this particular ride, it was jarring, it was visible by watching the seat in front of me, and it rattled my teeth. Combine that with the old-fashioned restraints, and it took a lot of joy out of this ride. I barely remember what happened, because I was concentrating on keeping an eye out down the track so that I could avoid anything painful that might be about to happen. So it was a lot less enjoying the coaster and more trying to defend myself against it. I have to say I'm really disappointed because I remember enjoying this one 12 years ago. Hogwarts Express At this point I was pretty much done with Islands of Adventure, so I needed to get over to Universal studios. There are two ways of doing this: you can go out the entrance and just walk over, or you can take the Hogwarts express. There didn't seem to be a lot of line for the train, and it's by far the more entertaining way to go, so I did that. I did have to wait a bit in line, probably the longest line I'd waited in so far today, but the experience was probably worth it. The train itself is a really good replica of the fictional train from the movies, and the events that take place while you're on the train, while fairly obvious if you've read the books, are at least accurate and entertaining. So I enjoyed this particular trip over. I noted that there did seem to be an option to just take the train across, without having the attraction experience, and that seemed reasonable if you'd already done it before. Escape from Gringotts Once I got off the train, I noted that the station on the Universal Studios end seemed to be a lot more elaborate and detailed then the one at the Islands end. That kind of makes thematic sense, since the Universal Studios terminal is supposed to be King's Cross in London, which is quite a large train station, one that I've been to. So I had to walk quite a bit to reach the exit, and then found myself on a replica of a London street, except in Florida, and extremely hot and humid. Walking down the street a little bit, I was able to find the \u201chidden\u201d entrance to Diagon Alley. Walking through that wall space into the alley is just as impressive as it is in the movies, and just as impressive as the Wizarding World at Islands. It's that strange experience of knowing exactly what you expect to see, but never having seen it in real life. So I spent quite a bit of time taking pictures and sending some of them to Alex, and I'm looking forward to going through the photos later on. I don't know if the Escape from Gringotts counts as a roller coaster proper, but I couldn't think of anything I wanted to do more in this location, and I suspected it would be air conditioned, so that sealed the deal. I had to do some fumbling around with a locker again, and the queue seemed to be 30 minutes or more, but I knew it would be indoors. The ride is more presentation and dark ride than it is roller coaster, much in the same way that the Indiana Jones ride isn't a roller coaster. However the scene in the bank that the ride is based on shows the bank vehicle to be very roller coaster-like. So who's to argue? The pre-show is extremely impressive, including a very well done fake elevator, and the decorations around the platform really make you feel like you're in a cave somewhere. The ride itself has a lot of presentation sections using video screens, which are unfortunately a bit more obvious than the ones in Forbidden journey. However, they're still pretty effective, and I did certainly enjoy the story. I'm still not sure if it's an actual roller coaster though. More walking After coming out of the bank, and out into the heat again, I did spend some time looking around the various set pieces and taking pictures. I was very surprised to find that there is a Nocturne Alley as part of this setup, and I did explore down it, and found it quite creepy, which seems appropriate. So I headed back out of the Wizarding World, and out onto the street. I didn't know exactly where I was, or which end of the park I was at, so I just kept walking in a clockwise direction. I found the Men in Black section which convinced me that I was at the far end of the park and there was nothing more for me to see down here. I crossed a bridge into a very elaborate Simpsons themed area. I'm not a huge fan of the Simpsons, any more than a person my age would be, but I certainly understand a lot of references, just because the thing has been around for so long, and of course because of my last boss who's a huge fan. In fact I was seeing most of the displays through his eyes. So I made sure to take a lot of photos, some of which I have already sent to him, and I hope he gets a big kick out of them. After walking far enough I eventually ended up back in the New York set, where there's a bunch of Transformers stuff. I decided not to do the Transformers ride because I couldn't think of a good reason to do so, but I did take a lot of pictures. I could see the one other roller coaster in this park, so I eventually went over in that direction. Hollywood Rip Ride Rockit This particular ride isn't anywhere near as well themed as all the other rides in Universal. I'd say it's mostly just a straight roller coaster, except it's kind of an unusual roller coaster. And while I have heard a lot of negative things said about it, I have heard a few people say positive things, so I went into this with a certain amount of trepidation. The line was again not particularly long, and after using an unnecessary locker again, I found myself on a ride vehicle pretty quickly. I knew that one of the features of this ride is that you get to pick your own soundtrack to listen to while you ride. I thought that was one of the cooler features, and I was looking forward to it. Unfortunately they seem to have drastically pared down the song list in the last few years, and nobody seems to know why. I was able to select from a list of genres, and when I selected Rock, I was given a list of exactly one song. I don't even remember what the song was now, but I didn't think it was appropriate for a roller coaster. I tried to go back and select something else, but by the time I got through the UI we were on the lift hill, and the whole thing shut off. Apparently the ride selected a song for me, some hip-hop thing that I'd never heard of before, and didn't seem terribly appropriate to a coaster. The guy I was sitting next to seemed to enjoy it though. The ride has a vertical lift hill, which I normally don't care for, but it's not really all that tall, and doesn't seem as open as other vertical lifts I've experienced before, so it didn't really bother me. What does bother me is that the first drop is a lot more shallow than you would expect from a vertical lift. It goes into a non-inverting loop at this point, and that's when I started to notice the rattle. It was hard enough of a rattle to be very uncomfortable, and strangely there was something wrong with the seats. I'm an adult male of roughly average height, and the way the seats were configured made me feel like my legs were too short. The plastic cut into the backs of my knees, and I couldn't quite get my feet to the floor, just the tips of my toes. Combine that with the strange restraints and the whole ride was very uncomfortable. The layout is somewhat uninspired, with lots of block brakes, and given that I was already uncomfortable, and there was a bad rattle, I didn't spend a whole lot of time paying attention to the layout. I just hoped it would be over soon. And it didn't really last that long, because the ride\u2019s not that good. So I got off, and did my best to forget about it altogether. So two coasters in the morning were great, and two in the afternoon were very disappointing. Hogwarts Express I wandered around the fake city sets for a little bit after that, but it was too hot in the afternoon, and city blocks and pavement don\u2019t allow very much relief from the sun. I noticed that the set isn't just New York; I'd seen London, and I was surprised to walk through a section that was very distinctly San Francisco. I'm not sure why fake San Francisco was more disconcerting to me than fake New York; it just was. So I fairly quickly decided that I was done for the day, and although it was perhaps a little early, I decided that the weather and the dehydration were sufficient justification. So I headed back to the train station with the intent of taking the Hogwarts Express back to Islands. I noted that the sign said there was a 60-minute wait, but I just assumed that was wrong, because the wait on the Islands end hadn't been anywhere near that long. Turns out the sign was accurate. So I waited in an extremely long line, probably the longest of this trip so far, for a ride experience that I didn't particularly want to have. I would have preferred to skip the attraction portion of the ride and just transport back. But either I didn't understand what I saw on the Islands end, or you can't get that version from Studios. Regardless, I was inside, and I was air-conditioned. So eventually I made my way back into Islands, with the intention of doing just a bit of shopping, and then heading home. I got a late message from Creech, telling me that the ride he was working on was down and had been for some time, and that if I came by he could chat for a few minutes. So I did that, and he really meant a few minutes. Creech is certainly dedicated to his job. It was a nice chat, but it was short, and so I finished my shopping and headed for home, right about rush hour. That was fine, perhaps a little earlier than I expected, but I decided that my overall health would be better served by not pushing my limits on this particular day.","title":"Universal Orlando"},{"location":"coasters/2023/universalorlando/#universal-islands-of-adventure-universal-studios-florida","text":"Visited: September 11, 2023 Attending: Just Brian The Busch Gardens parks were things that I know how to do. They were new parks for me, sort of, but they're still amusement parks of the sort that I'm accustomed to. Disney, and by extension Universal, are expert-level theme parks. They require extra planning, and you have to anticipate bigger crowds. I knew I was coming during what supposed to be the off season, and I planned reasonably well, but I was doing this solo, so I knew that there might be some complications that I missed. Nevertheless I planned my morning out properly, allowed plenty of time, arrived at the parking facility around 8:40, and was rewarded with a truly amazing parking spot. It was just luck of the draw, but I ended up just a couple of slots from the front of the parking structure. From there, it was a couple of escalators, some long paths, a complicated security process that I did not remember from last time, and then a decent hike through the Universal Citywalk to get to the park. Fortunately electronic admission was no problem and I soon found myself at the edge of the lake. It wasn't nine yet, so those of us without special permissions were standing around waiting to be let into the rest of the park. And there were more people than I hoped to see. It probably was an off-season crowd, but it certainly wasn't a ghost town. My plan was to get to Hagrid\u2019s first thing. Unfortunately, everyone else had the same plan, and the stated wait time was about 100 minutes when I arrived. The stated wait time for Velocicoaster, however, was given at 15 minutes. So when I got to the appropriate fork in the path, I made a game-time decision, and headed into Jurassic World to ride the brand-new coaster.","title":"Universal Islands of Adventure / Universal Studios Florida"},{"location":"coasters/2023/universalorlando/#velocicoaster","text":"I arrived at Velocicoaster over the bridge behind Hogwarts with the big black netting over top, which I'd seen in many photos and videos before now. I also had a pretty good idea of what the entrance looks like. Fortunately the crowd really was very sparse at this point. The single-rider line wasn't operating at this point because it didn't really need to. So I just joined the general queue, and really bypassed most of the pre-show activities, because there was nobody waiting. As a result, I screwed up the locker system, and locked my little temporary pass card inside the locker. Regardless I was up on the platform almost before I knew it. Which is kind of a shame because it's got a pretty good pre-show, but I figured I could see that later. I strapped myself in, noticed the comfortable restraints, and the comfortable seat as well. The train rolled out, hit its first launch, and soon I was zooming all around a velociraptor paddock. The track goes in and out of the rock work, pretty much as I expected. It feels like close shaves, but of course it isn't really. There were some noises around, but I had difficulty focusing on anything in particular this first time through. I did notice a similarity to Taron, which is another coaster that I've never been on, but I know what it looks like, and it's compared frequently to Velocicoaster.

I spent quite a bit of time in a few stores, looking for something that Alex or Jude might appreciate, but I came up a little bit short. The items are very Avengers-centric, which I really should have expected given the parameters of the contract. However the signage and the rides outside make use of a broader range of characters, so I forgot that they wouldn't all be represented in merchandise. I was particularly disappointed by the lack of Squirrel Girl, which caused me to realize that there weren't going to be any deep cuts here.","title":"Walking"},{"location":"coasters/2023/universalorlando/#spider-man","text":"The Spider-Man dark ride is one that I experienced last time I was here, but I did it in kind of a hurry. I had an express pass at the time, and very little time, so I rushed through the queue and rode it. So I decided to go with the general populace this time, partially because it was still early and I had nothing better to do, partially because it was inside and air-conditioned, and partially to see what I'd missed before. The pre-show is animated, and uses a lot of art style from what looks like a very \u201890s cartoon. Maybe that's intentional, because the '90s Spider-Man cartoon was very popular, but the crude animation and the style of writing are both very over the top. It was probably appropriate when the ride was created, but now that we've had 15 years of Marvel movies taking these characters very seriously, something like this show seems a bit like mockery. The ride itself is pretty good, and much like last time, I would have liked it much better if the Forbidden Journey wasn't a thing that exists. It's a first-rate dark ride that's also the second best dark ride in the park. The plot is still extremely silly and while there are some very nice set pieces, and a very dramatic ending, it's not particularly groundbreaking. Still, I got what I wanted out of it.","title":"Spider-Man"},{"location":"coasters/2023/universalorlando/#incredible-hulk","text":"Hulk was another roller coaster that I remember from my previous visit in 2011. I wasn't much of an enthusiast then, but I do remember liking it. I know that it's been completely re-tracked since then, and the pre-show was rebuilt, so I was interested to see what was going on. I did learn that I was going to have to use a locker and empty my pockets thoroughly for all rides, not just Velocicoaster. Once I got inside there wasn't much time to appreciate the pre-show; I was on the platform and on the train almost immediately. The launch tunnel was more impressive than I remember, and the launch itself may have been a bit more forceful than I remember. Unfortunately, the ride doesn't seem to be smoother than I remember. In fact it's a lot worse. I've never been one to complain about the B&M rattle, although other enthusiasts complain about it a lot. On this particular ride, it was jarring, it was visible by watching the seat in front of me, and it rattled my teeth. Combine that with the old-fashioned restraints, and it took a lot of joy out of this ride. I barely remember what happened, because I was concentrating on keeping an eye out down the track so that I could avoid anything painful that might be about to happen. So it was a lot less enjoying the coaster and more trying to defend myself against it. I have to say I'm really disappointed because I remember enjoying this one 12 years ago.","title":"Incredible Hulk"},{"location":"coasters/2023/universalorlando/#hogwarts-express","text":"At this point I was pretty much done with Islands of Adventure, so I needed to get over to Universal studios. There are two ways of doing this: you can go out the entrance and just walk over, or you can take the Hogwarts express. There didn't seem to be a lot of line for the train, and it's by far the more entertaining way to go, so I did that. I did have to wait a bit in line, probably the longest line I'd waited in so far today, but the experience was probably worth it. The train itself is a really good replica of the fictional train from the movies, and the events that take place while you're on the train, while fairly obvious if you've read the books, are at least accurate and entertaining. So I enjoyed this particular trip over. I noted that there did seem to be an option to just take the train across, without having the attraction experience, and that seemed reasonable if you'd already done it before.","title":"Hogwarts Express"},{"location":"coasters/2023/universalorlando/#escape-from-gringotts","text":"Once I got off the train, I noted that the station on the Universal Studios end seemed to be a lot more elaborate and detailed then the one at the Islands end. That kind of makes thematic sense, since the Universal Studios terminal is supposed to be King's Cross in London, which is quite a large train station, one that I've been to. So I had to walk quite a bit to reach the exit, and then found myself on a replica of a London street, except in Florida, and extremely hot and humid. Walking down the street a little bit, I was able to find the \u201chidden\u201d entrance to Diagon Alley. Walking through that wall space into the alley is just as impressive as it is in the movies, and just as impressive as the Wizarding World at Islands. It's that strange experience of knowing exactly what you expect to see, but never having seen it in real life. So I spent quite a bit of time taking pictures and sending some of them to Alex, and I'm looking forward to going through the photos later on. I don't know if the Escape from Gringotts counts as a roller coaster proper, but I couldn't think of anything I wanted to do more in this location, and I suspected it would be air conditioned, so that sealed the deal. I had to do some fumbling around with a locker again, and the queue seemed to be 30 minutes or more, but I knew it would be indoors. The ride is more presentation and dark ride than it is roller coaster, much in the same way that the Indiana Jones ride isn't a roller coaster. However the scene in the bank that the ride is based on shows the bank vehicle to be very roller coaster-like. So who's to argue? The pre-show is extremely impressive, including a very well done fake elevator, and the decorations around the platform really make you feel like you're in a cave somewhere. The ride itself has a lot of presentation sections using video screens, which are unfortunately a bit more obvious than the ones in Forbidden journey. However, they're still pretty effective, and I did certainly enjoy the story. I'm still not sure if it's an actual roller coaster though.","title":"Escape from Gringotts"},{"location":"coasters/2023/universalorlando/#more-walking","text":"After coming out of the bank, and out into the heat again, I did spend some time looking around the various set pieces and taking pictures. I was very surprised to find that there is a Nocturne Alley as part of this setup, and I did explore down it, and found it quite creepy, which seems appropriate. So I headed back out of the Wizarding World, and out onto the street. I didn't know exactly where I was, or which end of the park I was at, so I just kept walking in a clockwise direction. I found the Men in Black section which convinced me that I was at the far end of the park and there was nothing more for me to see down here. I crossed a bridge into a very elaborate Simpsons themed area. I'm not a huge fan of the Simpsons, any more than a person my age would be, but I certainly understand a lot of references, just because the thing has been around for so long, and of course because of my last boss who's a huge fan. In fact I was seeing most of the displays through his eyes. So I made sure to take a lot of photos, some of which I have already sent to him, and I hope he gets a big kick out of them. After walking far enough I eventually ended up back in the New York set, where there's a bunch of Transformers stuff. I decided not to do the Transformers ride because I couldn't think of a good reason to do so, but I did take a lot of pictures. I could see the one other roller coaster in this park, so I eventually went over in that direction.","title":"More walking"},{"location":"coasters/2023/universalorlando/#hollywood-rip-ride-rockit","text":"This particular ride isn't anywhere near as well themed as all the other rides in Universal. I'd say it's mostly just a straight roller coaster, except it's kind of an unusual roller coaster. And while I have heard a lot of negative things said about it, I have heard a few people say positive things, so I went into this with a certain amount of trepidation. The line was again not particularly long, and after using an unnecessary locker again, I found myself on a ride vehicle pretty quickly. I knew that one of the features of this ride is that you get to pick your own soundtrack to listen to while you ride. I thought that was one of the cooler features, and I was looking forward to it. Unfortunately they seem to have drastically pared down the song list in the last few years, and nobody seems to know why. I was able to select from a list of genres, and when I selected Rock, I was given a list of exactly one song. I don't even remember what the song was now, but I didn't think it was appropriate for a roller coaster. I tried to go back and select something else, but by the time I got through the UI we were on the lift hill, and the whole thing shut off. Apparently the ride selected a song for me, some hip-hop thing that I'd never heard of before, and didn't seem terribly appropriate to a coaster. The guy I was sitting next to seemed to enjoy it though. The ride has a vertical lift hill, which I normally don't care for, but it's not really all that tall, and doesn't seem as open as other vertical lifts I've experienced before, so it didn't really bother me. What does bother me is that the first drop is a lot more shallow than you would expect from a vertical lift. It goes into a non-inverting loop at this point, and that's when I started to notice the rattle. It was hard enough of a rattle to be very uncomfortable, and strangely there was something wrong with the seats. I'm an adult male of roughly average height, and the way the seats were configured made me feel like my legs were too short. The plastic cut into the backs of my knees, and I couldn't quite get my feet to the floor, just the tips of my toes. Combine that with the strange restraints and the whole ride was very uncomfortable. The layout is somewhat uninspired, with lots of block brakes, and given that I was already uncomfortable, and there was a bad rattle, I didn't spend a whole lot of time paying attention to the layout. I just hoped it would be over soon. And it didn't really last that long, because the ride\u2019s not that good. So I got off, and did my best to forget about it altogether. So two coasters in the morning were great, and two in the afternoon were very disappointing.","title":"Hollywood Rip Ride Rockit"},{"location":"coasters/2023/universalorlando/#hogwarts-express_1","text":"I wandered around the fake city sets for a little bit after that, but it was too hot in the afternoon, and city blocks and pavement don\u2019t allow very much relief from the sun. I noticed that the set isn't just New York; I'd seen London, and I was surprised to walk through a section that was very distinctly San Francisco. I'm not sure why fake San Francisco was more disconcerting to me than fake New York; it just was. So I fairly quickly decided that I was done for the day, and although it was perhaps a little early, I decided that the weather and the dehydration were sufficient justification. So I headed back to the train station with the intent of taking the Hogwarts Express back to Islands. I noted that the sign said there was a 60-minute wait, but I just assumed that was wrong, because the wait on the Islands end hadn't been anywhere near that long. Turns out the sign was accurate. So I waited in an extremely long line, probably the longest of this trip so far, for a ride experience that I didn't particularly want to have. I would have preferred to skip the attraction portion of the ride and just transport back. But either I didn't understand what I saw on the Islands end, or you can't get that version from Studios. Regardless, I was inside, and I was air-conditioned. So eventually I made my way back into Islands, with the intention of doing just a bit of shopping, and then heading home. I got a late message from Creech, telling me that the ride he was working on was down and had been for some time, and that if I came by he could chat for a few minutes. So I did that, and he really meant a few minutes. Creech is certainly dedicated to his job. It was a nice chat, but it was short, and so I finished my shopping and headed for home, right about rush hour. That was fine, perhaps a little earlier than I expected, but I decided that my overall health would be better served by not pushing my limits on this particular day.","title":"Hogwarts Express"},{"location":"coasters/2023/worldsoffun/","text":"Worlds of Fun Visited: June 23, 2023 Attending: Just Brian Shortly after returning from Australia, I headed to Kansas City for the KCDC conference, which I\u2019d never spoken at before. That was a lot of travel in a short period of time, but my new job messed up my schedule. Buzzed Bars held a Stumble in KC the weekend before I was there, which was unfortunate, but like I said, my schedule was messed up. If I was in KC, I wanted to drive down to Branson (see below), but Worlds of Fun is right there, and I thought I might have time to pick up all the credits, even if it was a whirlwind tour. After the conference on Friday, I taxied out to the airport, rented a car, and quickly zipped over. Fortunately, it wasn\u2019t very crowded at all, and most rides were station waits. Unfortunately, the very first coaster I came to, Spinning Dragons, was closed, thus ruining my plans to reach 200 credits that weekend. Still, I kept moving. Patriot Patriot is a B&M invert, which is a model I\u2019m very fond of. There was a bit of a line, which I extended by opting for the front row, but that\u2019s my preference when I\u2019m riding an invert for the first time. Patriot is on the edge of the park, so I wish I could say it had good views, but Worlds of Fun is pretty much surrounded by highways, and the ride sits in a grass field, so there wasn\u2019t much to look at. In fact, as inverts go, the whole thing was kind of forgettable. It\u2019s got a vertical loop and a zero-g, both of which are good on an invert, but these felt just average. It\u2019s not big like Banshee, nor intense like a Batman. It doesn\u2019t have a unique layout like Great Bear or Silver Bullet. There\u2019s no cobra roll, no helix. It\u2019s just kinda there. It would probably be more memorable if I\u2019d gone on a few more laps, but I didn\u2019t have time. Timber Wolf Timber Wolf was next up, and I honestly didn\u2019t know anything about this coaster going in. I do like wolves, though, and I was impressed by the sign and the queue area that I didn\u2019t wait in, because there was no line. Again, I barely remember anything about the coaster itself, which is kinda sad. It\u2019s a Dinn & Summers creation, which is usually a very bad sign, but this wasn\u2019t too bad. There was evidence of some recent retracking that smoothed things out some. There wasn\u2019t any airtime that I recall, and nothing too intense. Apparently it used to have a helix that has since been removed. Again, it\u2019s just there. Mamba Mamba is a Morgan hyper, a large and visually impressive model, of which very few were ever built. However, I\u2019ve been on Steel Force at Dorney a number of times, so I had a pretty good idea what to expect. Although the total height is over 200 feet, the first drop is annoyingly shallow. That\u2019s followed by a single airtime hill before the helix, which is pretty intense. Then an annoying mid-course brake run, followed by bunny hops all the way back to the station. I was in the back row, and I recall the bunny hops being rather jolting, so I guess the mid-course wasn\u2019t hitting all that hard on this occasion. I like big airtime hills in my hypers, though, and this only had one of them, which was disappointing. There\u2019s some terrain to be found right by Mamba, but it doesn\u2019t take any advantage of it. It doesn\u2019t even have the views that Steel Force does. Sadly, it\u2019s a ho-hum hyper. Boomerang I was now proceeding down into the valley section of the park, which I hadn\u2019t known was there, but they hide a bunch of coasters back there. This, however, is just a Boomerang, like any other. There was no line at all, but it\u2019s still a shuttle coaster, so the operations were slow. I actually haven\u2019t ridden a ton of Boomerangs, so maybe I shouldn\u2019t complain about them, but there was nothing special about this one. Zambezi Zinger After a string of \u201cnothing special\u201d rides, this was the one I was looking forward to most. And as the new hit ride in the park, it had quite a line. Zambezi Zinger has an interesting history: it was a 1973 Schwarzkopf with a spiral lift hill, a sibling to Whizzer at Great America. However, the original Zinger was relocated to Columbia in 1997. This new model stands on the same spot, also with a spiral lift, but it\u2019s a wooden GCI instead of a steel model. It also features GCI\u2019s steel Titan Track, but only on the lift hill, so you can\u2019t really tell what difference it makes. As luck would have it, I got seated in the front row to fill an empty seat; I\u2019d wanted the back, but the front was a nice second choice. The Infinity Flyer trains are very open, especially in the front, so I had an excellent view of the track. The lift was unusual, but just a curiosity. The ride experience, though, was excellent. Late in the day, with a full train, it was really hauling. Plus, it\u2019s a brand-new GCI, so it was as smooth as you get with a wooden coaster. The overbanked turns are really banked, the train keeps a lot of speed throughout, and it\u2019s got some nice directional changes that are very reminiscent of Mystic Timbers. I really enjoyed this ride, and I wish the line had been shorter so I could go around again. Prowler Prowler was the last stop for the day, hidden near the lowest point of the park. I was confused about this one before I rode; I somehow got into my head that it was old and painful, and an RMC candidate, but that\u2019s something else. It\u2019s a 2009 GCI, so it\u2019s not particularly old. Given my confusion, I wasn\u2019t expecting a twister layout. It\u2019s not too extreme, but being back in the woods enhances the feeling of not knowing what\u2019s going to happen next. There wasn\u2019t much in the way of air, but there were a couple of surprising moments. Given that I had very low expectations, I was pleasantly surprised. It was starting to get late at this point, even though it was midsummer. I took one quick check to see if Spinning Ninjas had magically opened (it hadn\u2019t) and headed back to my hotel.","title":"Worlds of Fun"},{"location":"coasters/2023/worldsoffun/#worlds-of-fun","text":"Visited: June 23, 2023 Attending: Just Brian Shortly after returning from Australia, I headed to Kansas City for the KCDC conference, which I\u2019d never spoken at before.

Which I figured was fine, as I didn\u2019t need to get any credits. The day itself was gloomy, heavily overcast with highs in the mid-50s, which may have kept the crowds down a bit. It seemed that during the day, the park was mostly populated by families with kids doing Halloween activities, and the real scare stuff would draw crowds after dark. Bottom line: although it seemed crowded, nobody was riding roller coasters. An ideal situation! Nighthawk The last couple times I was at Carowinds, I mainly rode the \u201cbig four,\u201d but this time I decided to be a little different. I hadn\u2019t ridden Nighthawk since 2017, and the Vekoma Flying Dutchman is an endangered species, so I wanted to give it another shot. Although the line wasn\u2019t too long, there was only one train running, and operations on this coaster take forever even when things are going well. Still, I think I only waited maybe 10-15 minutes. I ended up in row 3, which wouldn\u2019t have been my choice, but the grouper had her reasons. It\u2019s not like there\u2019s a bad view from any row on this one anyway. Rolling out of the station on our backs was uncomfortable, but the tilt of the lift hill soon fixed that. I wish there was a better view, but Carowinds is mostly flat. After that, it was OK. The layout doesn\u2019t really compare well to B&M flyers, especially not Tatsu, but it has some nice swoopiness over the water. The vertical loop is the inverse of a pretzel loop, and I did feel the g\u2019s in my legs as that was happening. Overall, I don\u2019t think it was as rough as people say. I\u2019m not in a huge rush to ride it again given the pokey ops, but I wouldn\u2019t say no to it either. Update, December 2024: Carowinds announced that Nighthawk was closing for good. So I guess that last ride was my goodbye ride. Kinda wish I\u2019d known at the time, but I don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve done anything different. Vortex Riding Vortex next was mostly an act of masochism. Now that Apocalypse has been converted, Vortex is easily the worst of the remaining stand-ups. That said, there aren\u2019t many remaining stand-ups. Green Lantern is rumored to be on its way out as of this writing, and Vortex isn\u2019t doing much better. In fact, I was surprised it was open at all, so I took the chance. I went for row 4, choosing not to invite disaster, and kept my head forward in the accepted B&M defensive riding position. That mostly worked out, as I didn\u2019t get banged around, but I was aware that I could have.

Copperhead Strike After those two, I decided that my desire to be fair to things I\u2019d last ridden in 2017 didn\u2019t extend to the wild mouse or the Vekoma boomerang, and I had no compelling reason to ride Hurler, so I had a leisurely lunch at Chickie\u2019s & Pete\u2019s, and then moved on to Copperhead Strike, which was also a station wait, even though the park was getting more crowded. I was dismally aware that the jo-jo roll this ride opens with might cause a similar reaction to the slow roll on Thunderbird last week, and also that I\u2019d eaten way too much cheese with lunch, but I managed it with no ill effects. I really wish I could remember the layout for this ride better, because it is a lot of fun, but \u201ctwisted mess\u201d is the only way I can really describe it. As always, the inversions are intentionally slow, providing a lot of hang-time for the rear of the train, where I was. There\u2019s a few hops with a little air, but mostly it\u2019s just about twisting around. Which is kind of a shame, because I think it could be a little more exciting than it is. But it\u2019s still fun, and those seats are totally comfortable. Afterburn Afterburn is the traditional next stop, so I went there next. Once again, there was no line, so I opted for the front row. I like to do front row on inverts, but I\u2019m pretty sure I never have on Afterburn, for reasons, usually involving rain. This time, I finally got a front row ride. However, I suspect that like Montu, Afterburn really is better from the back, because there isn\u2019t a whole lot to look at. Being able to see my way through the batwing tunnel was nice, but does reduce the impact of the element just a bit. On the whole, perfectly fine ride. Thunder Striker I then decided to hit up the former Intimidator, also known as \u201cnot that Intimidator, the other Intimidator,\u201d which isn\u2019t a problem anymore since it was renamed.

Except today, it spited me. The line was still very short, but the trains were cycling empty, with no indication of how long it would be down, so I bailed. Fury 325 Fury is the jewel of this park, and currently my #1 coaster. It had just a bit of a line, maybe 10 minutes, and I opted for row 6 instead of the back row, but the ops still crank the trains out on this ride, so I was on my way in a hurry. I figured that because of the cold, the ride might be a touch slow, but I needn\u2019t have worried. Fury soon made it clear that it had no intention of slowing down. I was on the right side of the train, which doesn\u2019t happen too often, so I got dipped downward on the first right-angle turn, which was pretty cool. I was also in prime position to appreciate that one support that looks close enough to touch (it isn\u2019t). As always, the airtime was pristine, the forces are perfectly balanced, and the treble clef drop remains one of my favorite elements on any coaster. Fury just has something that the others don\u2019t, even more than my favorite hypers. I don\u2019t know if it can be duplicated, but I\u2019d love to see them try. Although I\u2019ve often said I could ride Fury all day, I wanted to get to Raleigh in the early evening, so I left after just one ride. It was a short but satisfying visit overall.","title":"Carowinds"},{"location":"coasters/2024/carowinds/#carowinds","text":"Visited: October 27, 2024 Attending: Just Brian My Saturday evening hotel was pretty close to Carowinds, but I took some time in the morning to be responsible and practice my conference talk, so I didn\u2019t get to Carowinds until 45 minutes after open. Which I figured was fine, as I didn\u2019t need to get any credits. The day itself was gloomy, heavily overcast with highs in the mid-50s, which may have kept the crowds down a bit. It seemed that during the day, the park was mostly populated by families with kids doing Halloween activities, and the real scare stuff would draw crowds after dark. Bottom line: although it seemed crowded, nobody was riding roller coasters. An ideal situation!","title":"Carowinds"},{"location":"coasters/2024/carowinds/#nighthawk","text":"The last couple times I was at Carowinds, I mainly rode the \u201cbig four,\u201d but this time I decided to be a little different. I hadn\u2019t ridden Nighthawk since 2017, and the Vekoma Flying Dutchman is an endangered species, so I wanted to give it another shot. Although the line wasn\u2019t too long, there was only one train running, and operations on this coaster take forever even when things are going well. Still, I think I only waited maybe 10-15 minutes. I ended up in row 3, which wouldn\u2019t have been my choice, but the grouper had her reasons. It\u2019s not like there\u2019s a bad view from any row on this one anyway. Rolling out of the station on our backs was uncomfortable, but the tilt of the lift hill soon fixed that. I wish there was a better view, but Carowinds is mostly flat. After that, it was OK. The layout doesn\u2019t really compare well to B&M flyers, especially not Tatsu, but it has some nice swoopiness over the water. The vertical loop is the inverse of a pretzel loop, and I did feel the g\u2019s in my legs as that was happening. Overall, I don\u2019t think it was as rough as people say. I\u2019m not in a huge rush to ride it again given the pokey ops, but I wouldn\u2019t say no to it either. Update, December 2024: Carowinds announced that Nighthawk was closing for good. So I guess that last ride was my goodbye ride.

I reserved a spot for 9:00 Saturday morning, more or less on a whim. I discovered that this event was very different than the one I\u2019d attended for Wildcat\u2019s Revenge at Hershey last year. For one thing, the media day was held in advance of the passholder preview, so most of the folks who I might have hoped to see on preview day had already ridden it. The other major difference was that the park wasn\u2019t open for the season yet. The back section of the park was open, and while that\u2019s not small, it\u2019s not everything. It was also very sparsely attended at 9:00 on a Saturday morning. Iron Menace This is the big deal that I was there to ride, and given all the closed paths, that\u2019s where the traffic was directed, so I headed there first. The new orange track really pops against the background of the park. In fact, when you enter the lower parking lot, the inclined loop is right there in your face, so it\u2019s hard to miss. The drop faces the midway, so that\u2019s pretty cool too. The whole lower area of the park is now the \u201cSteel Yard\u201d section, which honors Allentown\u2019s roots as a steel town, we\u2019ve heard it before. They had some music that I can only assume is \u201cindustrial\u201d going around the entrance; I wonder if you\u2019ll be able to hear that when it\u2019s not empty. It\u2019s got a pretty nice sign, and I imagine it\u2019ll look pretty good once the grass grows in. I headed over to the entrance, saw that there was no line at all, but then got sent back down when I discovered we needed to get a paper ticket at a booth by the gift shop, something that nobody had told me and I had no way of knowing. However, that only took a minute and again, there was no line. Seemed kind of odd for the big attraction to be a walk-on. There was one spot in the queue that looked well-decorated. I\u2019ve heard that there\u2019s some good theming to this ride, but if there\u2019s a pre-show or anything like that, I must have bypassed it. Anyway, given that it was a walk-on, I figured front row was the way to go. I got the second seat from the edge, which was a slightly new experience for me, as I always seem to end up on the edge when I ride solo. It has the usual vest restraints and the grab bars, which I expected, but universally acknowledged to be inferior to the older restraints. The lift rises straight out of the station, and then heads straight forward to the drop. This is the first dive coaster I\u2019ve seen without a 90- or 180-degree turn at the top, so that was unusual. There is a short straight section right before the holding brake, but I only got a bit of time to look around. Given that the ride is at the bottom of the hill Dorney is built on, I had a pretty good view of all the other coasters. The hang itself was just a few seconds, no big deal at all, but it had the usual effect on the other riders. I noticed there\u2019s something painted on the ground at the lowest point that looks like it\u2019s supposed to be a smelting pit of some kind. If that\u2019s lit up at night, that could look really cool, but during the day, it\u2019s not very impressive. The drop is 95 degrees, which I appreciated. Much like Yukon Striker, I could feel the moment when the road wheels re-engaged with the track. The big drop is followed by a big old Immelmann, which is common on dive coasters, and provided a little bit of air, which was cool. That\u2019s followed by a zero-g roll taken high in the air, which is also pretty cool. You\u2019ve got a good head of speed at that point, so the roll is effective. After that is the inclined loop, which is\u2026pretty dull, to be honest. Because of the incline, there are no positive or negative forces, really. It\u2019s visually impressive, but not while you\u2019re riding. I don\u2019t understand B&M\u2019s fascination with the things. Then a corkscrew, and the brakes. It\u2019s short for a dive coaster, in both height and length, which is kind of disappointing. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019d have to rank it near the bottom of the dive coaster list, and since I\u2019m not much of a fan of those to start with, it\u2019s not a great addition. However, it does look like Cedar Fair\u2019s new dedication to theming is in effect (hope that survives the merger), and riding a newly built coaster is always fun. The brake fins were so shiny! Since there was literally no line at all, I figured it couldn\u2019t hurt to go ask for a re-ride. I wanted to try it from the back. Alas, my paper ticket was rejected for another go-round, and it looked like they had an operational delay not long after that, so I took some photos and moved on. Steel Force Possessed is right next to Iron Menace, but I don\u2019t really like Impulse coasters, so I ignored it. (I have no idea how that\u2019s supposed to fit the theme, anyway.) Steel Force was a short walk across the bridge, and although I would rather have ridden Talon or Hydra, they weren\u2019t open. Not many people were heading for Steel Force, and I briefly thought I\u2019d get a zen ride, but a handful of other people showed up. With a light train, and early in the morning, it wasn\u2019t a particularly intense ride, and I just rode it a few months ago, so nothing really unexpected happened. That helix still pulls a lot of G\u2019s, but sadly the airtime on the hills is kinda lacking. Thunderhawk I\u2019ve had some pretty bad rides on Thunderhawk in the past, and I thought about skipping it, but it\u2019s 100 years old this year, and there was literally nothing else to ride, so what the heck. Once again, I almost got a zen ride, but a handful of other folks showed up. I was expecting to get beat up, but surprisingly, the track was pretty smooth, for a 100-year-old woodie. I wonder if they did some work on it over the off-season. Turns out that if it\u2019s not beating you up, Thunderhawk doesn\u2019t do a whole lot. It\u2019s not very long, and the drops are kinda shallow. There isn\u2019t any airtime to be found here. Still, I was pleasantly surprised, so I\u2019ll take that as a win.

Several times I\u2019ve made a plan to go to their Holiwood Nights enthusiast event, but something always comes up to prevent me. The park is in southern Indiana, and not at all easy to get to, but if you invest the time to do Kings Island and Kentucky Kingdom, which I just did, then Holiday World is an easy addition. I was a bit worried about my strategy. I knew that Halloween events draw big crowds at parks nowadays, as evidenced by the mob scene at Kings Island on Saturday. And with a park themed to holidays, I reasonably expected even heavier crowds. Plus, the park is only open from 11 until 5. But there were only five credits to get, so maybe it would even out? Well, it turned out I didn\u2019t need that much strategery. I had a failure of time zone math, so I arrived a little after opening, which worried me, but the parking lot wasn\u2019t crowded at all. (The \u201cRaven\u201d lot, which is technically the overflow lot, but it\u2019s so massive that I\u2019d say it\u2019s the main lot, and the other one is premium.) A few general comments: Free parking rocks. Free sodas rock even more. I saw so many people wandering around with cups, I figured it was a smart move so guests couldn\u2019t get dehydrated. Which makes what happened to me later very unusual, but I\u2019ll get to that. It\u2019s also an amazingly gorgeous park. The main hill of Voyage dominates the skyline from almost every angle, and just begs you to take pictures of it. Thunderbird is no slouch either, perched up the hill as it is. You just want to have your camera out all the time, but I concentrated on getting the mission done first. Good Gravy! As silly as it sounds, this family coaster was my top priority. It\u2019s brand new, and it\u2019s tame enough for anybody to ride, both of which draw crowds. On top of that, it\u2019s a shuttle coaster, so it can\u2019t ever run more than one train. That\u2019s a recipe for a capacity nightmare. However, I didn\u2019t know just how elongated this park is, and how far in the back Good Gravy sits. So it was a station wait when I got there. Which is kind of a shame, because this coaster is so heavily themed\u2026to Thanksgiving. If any park is going to do that, it\u2019s Holiday World, but they really went all-in on the theme. The queue is surrounded by rooms from an American household in the mid-20th century. Could be anywhere from the 50s to the 70s. The ride itself is in the \u201cgarage\u201d of the home, complete with a wall covered in license plates. I really wanted a closer look, but there wasn\u2019t any line. The train cars are shaped like gravy boats, with a big handle on the back car, so of course I took that seat. It\u2019s a \u201cfamily boomerang\u201d model, so it launches by creeping backward up a hill, just like a regular boomerang. In the back seat, I had some incredible views over the rest of the park. The rest of the ride, well, it\u2019s a family coaster. It\u2019s got a custom layout through giant-sized food products and kitchen utensils, which is awesome, but all it really does is waggle back and forth. There\u2019s an impressive-looking spike, but the train barely gets halfway up before rolling back the way it came. It\u2019s a family coaster for sure, and would be skippable if it weren\u2019t for the incredible theming. In fact, it would probably still be skippable even with the theming, but this is the one park where the theming works and feels natural. So I started my visit with a smile on my face. Thunderbird Thunderbird is an odd duck in a few ways. It\u2019s a B&M steel coaster in a park known for wood coasters. It was also the only wing coaster with a launch, at least until the family models started coming out a year or two ago. China really seems to love wing coasters; in America we only built four, this is the last of the four that I\u2019ve ridden, and consensus is that it\u2019s the best one. I find it hard to disagree. Although I don\u2019t know if the launch was really necessary, it\u2019s got a good kick to it, and the immelmann it rolls into is nice and tight. The vertical loop is gigantic and graceful, and provides a neat near-miss with the supports, which I didn\u2019t expect. I\u2019ve been annoying in the past about insisting that wing coasters should have a near-miss element. This one has a shack, which doesn\u2019t have quite the suspense element that Gatekeeper or X-Flight have, but it does go through the shack twice. Also, kudos for having part of the cutout look like a rider\u2019s raised hands; that was funny. The inline twist that comes right at the very end is really strange. It\u2019s really slow, comparatively speaking, so you can feel the direction of gravity all the way through, which I didn\u2019t think would bother me, but it really did. I did my first ride in the front row, right side, because I enjoy riding wing coasters from the front. I enjoyed it enough that I went right back around to ride it from the back, but there was a ride stoppage before I got on (odd, since the lines were so short). I decided to come back later instead of waiting. When I came back in mid-afternoon, it looked like the ride was still down, but while I was taking photos, they cycled a couple of empty trains, and then one with riders. So I figured I\u2019d try for a back-row ride. The line was longer, but the park was more crowded, and it still used less than 10 percent of the queue. However, when I got to that inline twist at the end, something went badly wrong with my equilibrium. I felt a strong sense of vertigo and had to close my eyes on the brake run. I didn\u2019t think I was likely to hurl, but I\u2019ve never hurled on a coaster, so I don\u2019t know what it feels like. I got most of my composure back, but I was still a little wobbly even after walking down the hill several minutes later. I figured I must have been dehydrated, but I really didn\u2019t feel that way. I helped myself to some free sweet tea, figuring the sugar might help. But the feeling never went away entirely. And although I very much wanted to ride Voyage again, I decided it was too risky and cut my day off there. But that\u2019s what happened at the end of the day. Before that\u2026 Voyage I normally don\u2019t worry too much about spoilers for roller coasters. I don\u2019t watch POVs and try to memorize the layout, but I also don\u2019t bother trying to maintain perfect suspense. It\u2019s possible that with the Voyage, I would rather have remained unspoiled. Because I had very high expectations going into this thing. I had considered delaying and trying to make this my #250 coaster, but given that I didn\u2019t know the crowd dynamics, and having seen Thunderbird just go down, I decided not to risk it. The line was a touch longer, but really no more than 15 minutes or so, and I extended it by waiting for the back row. Not sure if that was a good idea, in retrospect, and I had planned to do my second ride from elsewhere in the train, but, well, see above. The basic description of Voyage is accurate, in that it\u2019s like a B&M to start out with, featuring big airtime hills, but the airtime wasn\u2019t super-spectacular. Then it turns into a GCI in the back, twisting around and confusing you about where you are. And on the return stretch it\u2019s somehow an RMC. I knew the trims would be turned on for this ride, and I felt them hit, but we still kept up an absurd amount of speed rocketing back down the hill. By the time we got back to the station area, it was like we\u2019d lost no speed at all. And the ride just keeps going, and going, and going, when you think it\u2019s over. That\u2019s why I may have regretted the back row seat. The Voyage is extremely well maintained, but it\u2019s still a wood track, and it\u2019s still got massive PTC trains without the greatest restraints, so I did get banged up a bit in the back. When it finally came to an end, I did feel like I\u2019d just been through a car wreck. I wanted to sit down and take a break more than I wanted to re-ride. Could be my age, could be the seat, could be whatever underlying condition affected me later on, I dunno. Anyway, I do and did want to ride again, just not at that exact moment. Raven I headed back up to the front of the park, where Halloween-land is, mostly with the intent of finding something to eat. After, I discovered that the Legend was temporarily down, leading me to think this is something that happens frequently at this park. So I turned around and found the Raven instead. I expected long lines with its nearest neighbor closed, but instead it was a walk-on. The trains weren\u2019t even running fully loaded. Raven is the oldest and shortest of the Holiday World coasters, but that\u2019s not giving it its due. This would be a fantastic coaster in any other park. It uses the terrain brilliantly, and it\u2019s back in the woods where you can barely tell what\u2019s going to happen next. I have to imagine a night ride on this would be completely terrifying. Unfortunately, it wasn\u2019t as smooth as I would like, but I did choose the back row again, so that\u2019s on me. It\u2019s not like I don\u2019t know PTC trains when I see them. So again, it was fully satisfying, but I felt a little beat up after\u2026so I took a break and just sat around for a bit. Legend After a rest, I decided to see what was up with Legend, and found it running, so I guess there wasn\u2019t really much of a problem. There was a little bit of a line, but almost entirely within the station, and again, I did it to myself by waiting for the back row. As a side note, there\u2019s an old bell on the roof of the station that rings when they dispatch a train. It\u2019s actually a manual bell that\u2019s pulled by the ride op standing at the rear of the platform. I don\u2019t know why that\u2019s cool, but it is. Unlike Voyage, I had no idea of Legend\u2019s layout, and it\u2019s also hidden in the woods, so I had no clue what I was getting into. This thing has twists, and more twists, and tunnels, and more tunnels, and a helix that seems to go on forever, to the point where I was wondering just how long this ride was (over 4000 feet, if you\u2019re keeping score). The lateral forces on this thing were strong, and didn\u2019t let up. As with GhostRider a couple of years ago, I was glad I was riding solo, so I didn\u2019t fall all over my seat-mate. In any other park, this would be the headliner, and it probably was, until Voyage was built. It\u2019s still pretty stunning, and once again left me feeling somewhat beat up. Overall, Holiday World is a fantastic park with outstanding theming and great views. Unfortunately, it\u2019s in the middle of nowhere and has fairly short operating hours. I\u2019d love to get back on these rides, but I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll prioritize it now that I have the credits. Riding at Holiwood Nights with other enthusiasts seems very appealing, so that will probably be sufficient motivation.","title":"Holiday World"},{"location":"coasters/2024/holidayworld/#holiday-world","text":"Visited: October 20, 2024 Attending: Just Brian Holiday World is a park I\u2019ve been wanting to get to for a long while. Several times I\u2019ve made a plan to go to their Holiwood Nights enthusiast event, but something always comes up to prevent me. The park is in southern Indiana, and not at all easy to get to, but if you invest the time to do Kings Island and Kentucky Kingdom, which I just did, then Holiday World is an easy addition. I was a bit worried about my strategy. I knew that Halloween events draw big crowds at parks nowadays, as evidenced by the mob scene at Kings Island on Saturday. And with a park themed to holidays, I reasonably expected even heavier crowds. Plus, the park is only open from 11 until 5. But there were only five credits to get, so maybe it would even out? Well, it turned out I didn\u2019t need that much strategery. I had a failure of time zone math, so I arrived a little after opening, which worried me, but the parking lot wasn\u2019t crowded at all. (The \u201cRaven\u201d lot, which is technically the overflow lot, but it\u2019s so massive that I\u2019d say it\u2019s the main lot, and the other one is premium.) A few general comments: Free parking rocks. Free sodas rock even more. I saw so many people wandering around with cups, I figured it was a smart move so guests couldn\u2019t get dehydrated. Which makes what happened to me later very unusual, but I\u2019ll get to that. It\u2019s also an amazingly gorgeous park. The main hill of Voyage dominates the skyline from almost every angle, and just begs you to take pictures of it. Thunderbird is no slouch either, perched up the hill as it is. You just want to have your camera out all the time, but I concentrated on getting the mission done first.","title":"Holiday World"},{"location":"coasters/2024/holidayworld/#good-gravy","text":"As silly as it sounds, this family coaster was my top priority.

That\u2019s a recipe for a capacity nightmare. However, I didn\u2019t know just how elongated this park is, and how far in the back Good Gravy sits. So it was a station wait when I got there.

The park only has four credits I\u2019m interested in, so I figured I could sweep those up even if I only had a few hours to do it. Plus, I\u2019ve never been to Kentucky, and it kind of stands out on my \u201cstates visited\u201d map, which gave me a bit of incentive. So I called an audible on my hotel reservation, stopped very briefly at the Hard Rock Casino to pick up a pin, and headed down that way. This park seems strange. Or at least, it\u2019s strange in the way it\u2019s configured during its Halloween event. The park is bisected by a road, which makes moving around awkward. There\u2019s a large bridge between the two halves, and at least one staffed crosswalk that I could see. The back half of the park seems to be where most of the action is, with most of the coasters and the water park. However, the water park was closed for conversion to their winter event, leaving the impression that the back half was just a long strip along the road, with a \u201cpod\u201d at either end where the coasters are. Apparently this isn\u2019t the case during most of the year, so I kind of caught it at a bad time. Nevertheless, it\u2019s nearly impossible to see any of the coasters from anywhere in the park, which is very unusual. It\u2019s also unusual that the park is on the grounds of the Kentucky state fair and I guess convention center? That made the parking confusing. The parking booth that Google directed me to was for the convention center, and they didn\u2019t seem to have any idea about the amusement park, or whether my ticket included parking or what. So maybe I overpaid, maybe not; it\u2019s hard to tell. I was able to get a spot that wasn\u2019t too far from the entrance, but definitely closer to the convention center, so I can see why this is a point of contention. I also didn\u2019t know a ton about the coasters at this park. I had an idea of what they were, but I didn\u2019t exactly know what they\u2019d be like to ride. So I was going into this with a fair amount of curiosity. Lightning Run When I got inside the park, there was a Halloween parade going on right in front of me, so I slid around to the left, because I had seen Lightning Run over in that direction. Although the sight lines inside the park are terrible, Lightning Run has the virtue of being a very nice shade of blue, so it\u2019s not too hard to spot. There wasn\u2019t too much of a line, for which I was grateful, but it was also clear that they were only running one train, and the ops weren\u2019t exactly speedy. (This would become a theme for this trip.) I opted for the back row, and didn\u2019t have to wait very long. JohnMike had told me that Lightning Run used RMC restraints, which I generally find pretty comfortable, so I was pleased about that. I also discovered that Kentucky Kingdom is pretty strict about their loose-items policy. Or at least, they say they are. Given Allison\u2019s experience earlier in the day (which had nothing to do with a ride), I figured I\u2019d follow the rules and stowed my phone and keys in a bin. Plus points for not having paid lockers; minus points for having no security at all on the bins. The ride isn\u2019t all that tall, just 100 feet. It\u2019s not particularly long, either. And yet, it packs an absurd amount of elements into the ride. It\u2019s a Chance Hyper-GTX model, the only one of its kind so far, and I (and many enthusiasts) have no idea why. This thing is intense, with elements that seem too tight for the length of the train. Maybe I was biased because of the seats, but it felt like an RMC built on traditional steel track. The airtime was surprisingly intense, the transitions were sharp but not painful, and the whole experience got my heart racing. I have to wonder if this ride\u2019s appearance works against it, because it doesn\u2019t look that intense from the outside. I would\u2019ve done another lap, but I had other credits to get, and I wasn\u2019t feeling confident about the ops. Kentucky Flyer I found the bridge over the road pretty easily, then walked\u2026and walked\u2026and walked\u2026over to Kentucky Flyer. It was a calculated risk, choosing the family coaster over the RMC, but I hoped the ops would be quick. They decidedly were not. This ride is stupidly hard to find, way at the edge of the park, and then with an additional narrow path to traverse to get to the entrance, for most of which you can barely see the coaster. I started my wait on the stairs, and got to the station within a few cycles, but then got held up because of a \u201clost phone\u201d incident. They cycled the train near-empty (the only rider was the op who was coming off duty), which revealed the errant phone lying right there on the track. Ironically, it was much more visible to the people waiting at the air gates than the ops on the other side of the track. Most people in line bailed at that point, and the off-duty op was stuck on the brake run while we all waited for maintenance. I decided to stick it out, because I was pretty sure that picking up a clearly visible phone wasn\u2019t going to take long. I promised myself that I would put my phone and keys in the bin for every coaster at this park. Anyway, the ride itself was pretty darned good. Kentucky Flyer is the most notable of these Gravity Group family coasters, much like Oscar\u2019s Wacky Taxi at Sesame Place. It\u2019s definitely a family coaster, just under 50 feet tall, with an out-and-back layout, but it\u2019s got some nice Gravity Group twistiness even within the basic layout. The airtime was better than I expected from the back car. It wasn\u2019t super-exciting, but there was a definite feel of good air. This is no kiddie coaster, but it\u2019s still rideable for just about anybody. If you want to make a young person into an enthusiast, this should do the trick. Storm Chaser After an absurdly long walk across the park, I came across the entrance to Thunder Run, and then kept walking even further to get to Storm Chaser. This one is all the way out to the other edge of the park, with very little around it. There\u2019s a pretty nice waiting area on the infield, where the train is zipping around you in every direction. If I\u2019d had time to spend gawking \u2013 and if they\u2019d been running more than one train \u2013 it might have been a great spot to collect some off-ride footage. Unfortunately, I had business to attend to. Storm Chaser is one of the earlier \u201cconversion\u201d RMCs, like Wicked Cyclone, meaning it\u2019s designed by mad genius Alan Shilke. Unlike the New England masterpiece, this was a refurbishment of a wood-on-steel coaster, Twisted Twins, meaning it\u2019s now an all-steel RMC. That has a negative impact on the aesthetic, and the surroundings only make it worse, out in a weed-strewn field across the street from a bunch of warehouses and tractor trailers. It\u2019s very possibly the worst view from a coaster I\u2019ve ever seen. The original coaster on this site was a pair of dueling twister coasters, so the conversion doesn\u2019t spend time inside the structure like Wicked Cyclone or Steel Vengeance. Like Iron Gwazi, it\u2019s out there in a big loop, and you have very little idea where you are in the layout. The barrel-roll drop was more intense than the one on Twisted Timbers, starting with a distinct yank, and the coaster never lets up from there. There\u2019s overbanks, for the RMC value of \u201coverbank\u201d that actually means \u201cvery nearly invert you, then rip you back the way you came.\u201d One of those is a zero-g roll, but it\u2019s kinda hard to remember which one, because so much comes at you all at once. The helix near the end is crazy intense at a point where most trains are trying to shed speed, and it finishes with a head-chopper that\u2019s much more effective than it has any right to be. Storm Chaser is also the originator of the \u201ctrick track double-up,\u201d which sounds like one of those silly element names, but there\u2019s no other way to describe this. It\u2019s trick-track in the RMC fashion, which translates to \u201ctoss you violently to one side, then the other, with no pause in between.\u201d I\u2019d experienced the trick track on Twisted Timbers, but this one isn\u2019t even slightly kidding. \u201cViolent\u201d is the only word to describe it. Worse, Kentucky Kingdom put the on-ride photo point right at the start, so you\u2019re blinded right as the element starts, meaning you get no warning that you\u2019re about to get yeeted the other direction. It was bad during my sunset ride, and even worse on my second ride, which happened after dark. This is one of the more powerful RMCs I\u2019ve ridden, and I\u2019m not sure how many times in a row I could handle it. Thunder Run This is the only coaster left from the original era of the park, a Dinn Corporation woodie from 1990. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t know that going in, because I\u2019d have approached it with a lot more fear. However, this is the rare Dinn that\u2019s held up well, either through maintenance or sheer luck. I was a bit surprised to see the heavy PTC trains, and expected something a bit milder than what I got. And \u201cmild\u201d is not a word that belongs anywhere near this ride. It\u2019s a pretty standard double out-and-back, but the banking on the first turn after the drop makes it clear that this is from the person who designed Hercules. Like Storm Chaser, this thing doesn\u2019t let up at any point, and with the 1990s construction techniques, it\u2019s right on the edge of painful, perhaps just across it. I don\u2019t know that I could ride this a lot of times, but it\u2019s definitely worth a ride. After Thunder Run, I did another lap on Storm Chaser. I thought about doing one more, but the ops really were terrible. It was full dark, I hadn\u2019t gone back to the car to swap my glasses, and I hate being visually impaired in a darkened park, especially with the added chaos of a Halloween event going on. So I took my leave slightly early. Kentucky Kingdom, for all its strange history, is currently a really good half-day park for enthusiasts, or maybe a full day if you really like violence. The slow ops actually help to offset any ill effects from trying to marathon these super-intense coasters, by forcing you to take a break.","title":"Kentucky Kingdom"},{"location":"coasters/2024/kentuckykingdom/#kentucky-kingdom","text":"Visited: October 19, 2024 Attending: Just Brian Kentucky Kingdom wasn\u2019t in my original plan, but when I realized that Kings Island was likely to be mobbed, I chose to go ahead with it. The park only has four credits I\u2019m interested in, so I figured I could sweep those up even if I only had a few hours to do it. Plus, I\u2019ve never been to Kentucky, and it kind of stands out on my \u201cstates visited\u201d map, which gave me a bit of incentive. So I called an audible on my hotel reservation, stopped very briefly at the Hard Rock Casino to pick up a pin, and headed down that way. This park seems strange. Or at least, it\u2019s strange in the way it\u2019s configured during its Halloween event. The park is bisected by a road, which makes moving around awkward. There\u2019s a large bridge between the two halves, and at least one staffed crosswalk that I could see. The back half of the park seems to be where most of the action is, with most of the coasters and the water park. However, the water park was closed for conversion to their winter event, leaving the impression that the back half was just a long strip along the road, with a \u201cpod\u201d at either end where the coasters are. Apparently this isn\u2019t the case during most of the year, so I kind of caught it at a bad time. Nevertheless, it\u2019s nearly impossible to see any of the coasters from anywhere in the park, which is very unusual. It\u2019s also unusual that the park is on the grounds of the Kentucky state fair and I guess convention center? That made the parking confusing. The parking booth that Google directed me to was for the convention center, and they didn\u2019t seem to have any idea about the amusement park, or whether my ticket included parking or what. So maybe I overpaid, maybe not; it\u2019s hard to tell. I was able to get a spot that wasn\u2019t too far from the entrance, but definitely closer to the convention center, so I can see why this is a point of contention. I also didn\u2019t know a ton about the coasters at this park. I had an idea of what they were, but I didn\u2019t exactly know what they\u2019d be like to ride. So I was going into this with a fair amount of curiosity.","title":"Kentucky Kingdom"},{"location":"coasters/2024/kentuckykingdom/#lightning-run","text":"When I got inside the park, there was a Halloween parade going on right in front of me, so I slid around to the left, because I had seen Lightning Run over in that direction. Although the sight lines inside the park are terrible, Lightning Run has the virtue of being a very nice shade of blue, so it\u2019s not too hard to spot. There wasn\u2019t too much of a line, for which I was grateful, but it was also clear that they were only running one train, and the ops weren\u2019t exactly speedy. (This would become a theme for this trip.) I opted for the back row, and didn\u2019t have to wait very long. JohnMike had told me that Lightning Run used RMC restraints, which I generally find pretty comfortable, so I was pleased about that. I also discovered that Kentucky Kingdom is pretty strict about their loose-items policy. Or at least, they say they are. Given Allison\u2019s experience earlier in the day (which had nothing to do with a ride), I figured I\u2019d follow the rules and stowed my phone and keys in a bin. Plus points for not having paid lockers; minus points for having no security at all on the bins. The ride isn\u2019t all that tall, just 100 feet. It\u2019s not particularly long, either. And yet, it packs an absurd amount of elements into the ride. It\u2019s a Chance Hyper-GTX model, the only one of its kind so far, and I (and many enthusiasts) have no idea why. This thing is intense, with elements that seem too tight for the length of the train. Maybe I was biased because of the seats, but it felt like an RMC built on traditional steel track. The airtime was surprisingly intense, the transitions were sharp but not painful, and the whole experience got my heart racing. I have to wonder if this ride\u2019s appearance works against it, because it doesn\u2019t look that intense from the outside. I would\u2019ve done another lap, but I had other credits to get, and I wasn\u2019t feeling confident about the ops.","title":"Lightning Run"},{"location":"coasters/2024/kentuckykingdom/#kentucky-flyer","text":"I found the bridge over the road pretty easily, then walked\u2026and walked\u2026and walked\u2026over to Kentucky Flyer. It was a calculated risk, choosing the family coaster over the RMC, but I hoped the ops would be quick. They decidedly were not. This ride is stupidly hard to find, way at the edge of the park, and then with an additional narrow path to traverse to get to the entrance, for most of which you can barely see the coaster. I started my wait on the stairs, and got to the station within a few cycles, but then got held up because of a \u201clost phone\u201d incident. They cycled the train near-empty (the only rider was the op who was coming off duty), which revealed the errant phone lying right there on the track. Ironically, it was much more visible to the people waiting at the air gates than the ops on the other side of the track. Most people in line bailed at that point, and the off-duty op was stuck on the brake run while we all waited for maintenance. I decided to stick it out, because I was pretty sure that picking up a clearly visible phone wasn\u2019t going to take long. I promised myself that I would put my phone and keys in the bin for every coaster at this park. Anyway, the ride itself was pretty darned good. Kentucky Flyer is the most notable of these Gravity Group family coasters, much like Oscar\u2019s Wacky Taxi at Sesame Place. It\u2019s definitely a family coaster, just under 50 feet tall, with an out-and-back layout, but it\u2019s got some nice Gravity Group twistiness even within the basic layout. The airtime was better than I expected from the back car. It wasn\u2019t super-exciting, but there was a definite feel of good air. This is no kiddie coaster, but it\u2019s still rideable for just about anybody. If you want to make a young person into an enthusiast, this should do the trick.","title":"Kentucky Flyer"},{"location":"coasters/2024/kentuckykingdom/#storm-chaser","text":"After an absurdly long walk across the park, I came across the entrance to Thunder Run, and then kept walking even further to get to Storm Chaser. This one is all the way out to the other edge of the park, with very little around it. There\u2019s a pretty nice waiting area on the infield, where the train is zipping around you in every direction. If I\u2019d had time to spend gawking \u2013 and if they\u2019d been running more than one train \u2013 it might have been a great spot to collect some off-ride footage. Unfortunately, I had business to attend to. Storm Chaser is one of the earlier \u201cconversion\u201d RMCs, like Wicked Cyclone, meaning it\u2019s designed by mad genius Alan Shilke. Unlike the New England masterpiece, this was a refurbishment of a wood-on-steel coaster, Twisted Twins, meaning it\u2019s now an all-steel RMC. That has a negative impact on the aesthetic, and the surroundings only make it worse, out in a weed-strewn field across the street from a bunch of warehouses and tractor trailers. It\u2019s very possibly the worst view from a coaster I\u2019ve ever seen. The original coaster on this site was a pair of dueling twister coasters, so the conversion doesn\u2019t spend time inside the structure like Wicked Cyclone or Steel Vengeance. Like Iron Gwazi, it\u2019s out there in a big loop, and you have very little idea where you are in the layout. The barrel-roll drop was more intense than the one on Twisted Timbers, starting with a distinct yank, and the coaster never lets up from there. There\u2019s overbanks, for the RMC value of \u201coverbank\u201d that actually means \u201cvery nearly invert you, then rip you back the way you came.\u201d One of those is a zero-g roll, but it\u2019s kinda hard to remember which one, because so much comes at you all at once. The helix near the end is crazy intense at a point where most trains are trying to shed speed, and it finishes with a head-chopper that\u2019s much more effective than it has any right to be. Storm Chaser is also the originator of the \u201ctrick track double-up,\u201d which sounds like one of those silly element names, but there\u2019s no other way to describe this. It\u2019s trick-track in the RMC fashion, which translates to \u201ctoss you violently to one side, then the other, with no pause in between.\u201d I\u2019d experienced the trick track on Twisted Timbers, but this one isn\u2019t even slightly kidding. \u201cViolent\u201d is the only word to describe it.

As a result, I had less spare time and money than I have in years past, so I didn\u2019t visit any parks during the summer. However, by October, I had a new job that loosened the restraints on my spending a bit, and reintroduced me to business travel. I was requested by the new job to be in St. Louis for a meeting the week of the 21st. I needed to be in Raleigh the following week for the All Things Open conference. It started to seem like a road trip was in order, and given that I\u2019d never been to Six Flags St. Louis\u2026well, it kind of spiraled from there. I left home after work on Friday the 18th, and unusually for me, I didn\u2019t try to go to Kennywood. Instead, I drove about five hours to Ohio and stopped. The plan was to spend Saturday at Kings Island. I got in touch with Mullet, and he said that he and Allison would be happy to meet me there, and that JohnMike would come as well. So that looked like a promising start. I knew it would likely be crowded, but I figured I\u2019d take what I could get. Mystic Timbers I arrived right at opening time, following my standard strategy. Even still, the parking lot was filling quickly. The others wouldn\u2019t arrive for a while, they told me. I figured Mystic Timbers was a pretty good choice for a rope-drop coaster, as it\u2019s out of the way. I guessed right, and was rewarded with a station wait. Lots of people rave about Mystic as the best GCI. I\u2019m not entirely sold. It\u2019s good; it\u2019s intense from beginning to end, and has lots of twisting sections, especially at its furthest point in the layout. It does bear some resemblance to a wooden Maverick in that way. However, it uses the terrain, and lacks a really impressive drop, which I think is important. Also, the shed remains a completely nonsensical gimmick that just wastes time at the end of the ride. It was fun, but not mindblowing. Diamondback When I was here in 2022, Doug and I were unimpressed by Diamondback, which has a reputation as one of the best B&M hypers. I thought it deserved a redemption ride, and the entrance was convenient, so I went there next. It was still a fairly cool day, and I didn\u2019t want to risk getting wet, so I opted for row 12, rather than the back. Result: It\u2019s\u2026pretty good. There was more airtime than I remembered, which was good, but it\u2019s not super-sustained. It\u2019s got a trim right after the turnaround that was rather unfortunate. It\u2019s got two helixes, which I think is one too many. The problem is that it\u2019s an older hyper design. It\u2019s better than Apollo\u2019s Chariot or Raging Bull, but it doesn\u2019t have the super-refined profiling of a Mako or even Candymonium. Even comparing it to its own peers, I\u2019d prefer Nitro or Behemoth. So it wasn\u2019t a crushing disappointment, but it wasn\u2019t a revelation either. At this point, it was getting close to the time when I was expecting my friends, so I decided not to risk getting stuck in line for Orion or Beast.

I certainly wouldn\u2019t have had Racer on my list, given the unpleasant experience I had on it in 2022, but JohnMike assured me that Gravity Group had done a bunch of work on it over the offseason, and it was much better than I remembered. It was also racing both sides, which I never see in the older racing coasters anymore, so that was pretty cool. Darned if they weren\u2019t right about the restoration work. It was much smoother, and there were definite moments of airtime. Not magic airtime, but more than just a quick pop. Until the brakes, anyway, which were as rough as ever. I still don\u2019t know if I\u2019d have Racer high on my must-ride list, but it was a definite pleasant surprise. Adventure Express I\u2019m not really sure why we chose to ride this, but it was there, the line wasn\u2019t long, and I\u2019d declared that I didn\u2019t care much about what we rode. Unfortunately, Allison managed to drop her phone through the wooden slats in the queue, so we were worried about that for a while. And the ride\u2026was pretty bad, really.

Banshee was down, which may have contributed, but still, we didn\u2019t like the Bat quite that much. We took a look at the Son of Beast homage nearby, met up with the others, and then tried to find something without a terrible line. Unfortunately, we failed. Even Mystic Timbers had a wait of over an hour. It was a gorgeous day, a Saturday, and Haunt, so we knew that might happen.

I\u2019d been at a work meeting in St. Louis all week, which was perfectly nice. The meeting ended on Thursday, but if I wanted to hit up the park, I had to wait around all day Friday for it to open. Which I did, at a local public library, and then briefly at a mall. I suspected it would be crowded, as a Friday night with nice weather right before Halloween, and the line to get in proved me right. Fortunately, my Diamond pass afforded me a spot in the premium parking lot, so I saved a bit of time there, and not carrying a bag allowed me to skip security, so I breezed into the park shortly after opening. American Thunder Once again, I was operating without a map, but I could spot Mr. Freeze above the trees, and I figured that was the best direction to head. However, I came to American Thunder first, and it appeared to have no line, so I chanced a quick ride. It\u2019s a wooden GCI, only about 80 feet tall, with Millennium Flyer trains, so I didn\u2019t have high expectations. Being conscious of my violent wood-coaster rides at Kentucky Kingdom, I opted for a seat a few rows from the back, which may have been a good idea. It\u2019s not very tall, but it\u2019s awfully twisty, as one would expect from a GCI. And it was running pretty fast, which surprised me a bit. Just about the right length, and some decent air pops. I\u2019d put it in the upper half of GCI\u2019s, but not a standout. Mr. Freeze Reverse Blast This was my biggest priority at this particular park, because it\u2019s a mostly unique coaster. \u201cMostly\u201d because it has a twin at Six Flags Over Texas, but that one launches trains forward, whereas this one launches backward, hence \u201cReverse Blast.\u201d I\u2019ve been on a handful of coasters lately that feature spikes where the train stops and reverses direction. Generally speaking, I\u2019ve found that reversing up the spike is preferable, but on this occasion, with a coaster I\u2019d never ridden before, I think I would have preferred going forward up the spike, because it\u2019s a little less scary, in my opinion. I was worried about a line for this one, as it\u2019s a shuttle coaster, and it sometimes has reliability issues, but I needn\u2019t have been. The park was worried about it too, once upon a time, because the queue is absolutely massive. But at this moment, it was so empty that I had a hard time following where to go. I did get a good view of the ride, which really isn\u2019t all that long, and decided that it wasn\u2019t as tall as I feared. Of course, I should know better than to judge height or speed when I\u2019m on the ground, but I never learn. When I got to the station, there was no line at all, although it did fill gradually enough that each train was launching mostly full. The dual switch-track system for the launch is interesting from a technical perspective, but does nothing for the ride. I found the backward launch kind of intense, and taking the top hat backward, especially in the dark when I had no idea where it was, a bit nerve-wracking. The spike was no big deal, especially as it has no hold at the top, and simply drops the train once it reaches maximum height. Once I could see where I was going again, the forward stretch was no big deal at all, possibly even a bit short. The second time through the top hat had an unexpected loss of momentum right near the end, leading to some surprise hang-time, but that was kind of cool. I\u2019d ride it again sometime, but I had other things to do right then. Pandemonium At this point, it was pretty dark, and the Haunt atmospherics were in full effect, which meant a lot of dry ice. More than I\u2019ve seen at other Haunt events, in fact. I was trying to aim for the back of the park because I could see some other wood coasters back there. A rest-room stop consumed more time than I expected, because of the general confusion. Anyway, I came across Pandemonium next, and decided to give it a shot. The ride is a Gerstlauer spinner, cloned at several Six Flags parks, but by coincidence, I\u2019d never ridden one. Spinning Ninjas at Worlds of Fun was down last year, and although I\u2019d ridden the two at the Nickelodeon parks, I wasn\u2019t overly impressed with them. Pandemonium has a different layout, a bit more intense, I think, because of its origins as a Tony-Hawk themed coaster. There was a bit more of a line at this point, maybe a 15-minute wait. I ended up grouped with a Mom and two pre-teens, and that made the car really imbalanced, which always results in more spinning. Which most people really like; I could have done with a bit less. Personally, I prefer the Mack spinners, where the seats face away from the axis of the car, to the Gerstlaurs, where the seats face inward. However, going around a helix while sideways is always good fun, and that happened several times. Unfortunately, we still had a good bit of spin going on the brake run, which wasn\u2019t as fun, but there you are. The Boss This woodie was the next coaster I found, which was good, because it was my next highest priority. Once again, the queue was crazy long, requiring quite a hike from the midway. The park was also starting to fill up. I\u2019d been lucky so far, I think because I got there in daylight and the haunted houses were drawing most of the crowds, but my luck was starting to run out. There was also a distinct increase in fast-pass riders. I had to wait about 20 minutes, all told. The Boss has a bad reputation as being unbearably rough, which I accounted for by sitting a few rows from the back. Still, I didn\u2019t really know what to expect. It turned out to be a coaster of extremes. The bad first: It was unbearably rough. The handful of straight stretches and speed hills, I could feel my teeth slamming together, and a coaster headache coming on. I gave up on keeping my hands up and tried to hold on loosely, just to stabilize a little bit. Apparently there used to be a helix at the end, which has since been removed. I can\u2019t even imagine how bad that would have been. Now for the good: The layout is amazing. It\u2019s on the side of a hill, so although the official height is 120 feet, the drop is 150 feet, and the second hill is very nearly the same height. It\u2019s also on the edge of the park, which meant a good portion of the ride was in total darkness. If it had actually been smooth, the night ride would have been legendary. It keeps its speed all the way to the brakes, probably because of the missing helix, and again, that would have been awesome if I weren\u2019t begging for it to end. If you\u2019d told me that this was an old Dinn & Summers rather than a CCI, I would have believed you, because normally only Dinns beat me up that badly. At the time of this writing, in 2024, the Boss is probably the leading candidate for the RMC conversion treatment. Prior to riding this, I thought that was just because it\u2019s so rough, it should be put out of its misery. But now that I\u2019ve experienced the layout, I really want to see what RMC could do with this thing. It could very well be awesome. But even some Titan Track on the existing layout would do wonders. The Rest After the Boss, I became aware that the lines were getting kinda crowded, and I still had a two-hour drive to get to my hotel, so I wanted to bail by 7:30. The crowds and the Haunt were making it harder to navigate, and while I wasn\u2019t disturbed by that, I don\u2019t like it either. I managed to find the entrance to Screamin\u2019 Eagle with a little effort, but I estimated the line at 20 minutes or more. Not bad for a normal day, but that was when I decided to pull the rip cord. A shame, because a night ride on that could be very cool. I continued counter-clockwise around the park, just in case of miracles, but I didn\u2019t find any. The Boomerang wasn\u2019t running, which is fine by me; I didn\u2019t expect anything from that. Ninja was mildly interesting to me, as a custom Vekoma, but not enough to stand in line. The Batman clone was also of mild interest, as it\u2019s a mirror of the ones I\u2019ve ridden before. But still, a clone. So I left with fewer than half the credits, but I got Mr. Freeze and the Boss, and American Thunder was better than expected, so not bad.","title":"Six Flags St. Louis"},{"location":"coasters/2024/sixflagsstlouis/#six-flags-st-louis","text":"Visited: October 25, 2024 Attending: Just Brian This park was kind of the motivating factor for the whole trip, and also the one with the stupidest logistics. I\u2019d been at a work meeting in St. Louis all week, which was perfectly nice. The meeting ended on Thursday, but if I wanted to hit up the park, I had to wait around all day Friday for it to open. Which I did, at a local public library, and then briefly at a mall. I suspected it would be crowded, as a Friday night with nice weather right before Halloween, and the line to get in proved me right. Fortunately, my Diamond pass afforded me a spot in the premium parking lot, so I saved a bit of time there, and not carrying a bag allowed me to skip security, so I breezed into the park shortly after opening.","title":"Six Flags St. Louis"},{"location":"coasters/2024/sixflagsstlouis/#american-thunder","text":"Once again, I was operating without a map, but I could spot Mr. Freeze above the trees, and I figured that was the best direction to head. However, I came to American Thunder first, and it appeared to have no line, so I chanced a quick ride. It\u2019s a wooden GCI, only about 80 feet tall, with Millennium Flyer trains, so I didn\u2019t have high expectations. Being conscious of my violent wood-coaster rides at Kentucky Kingdom, I opted for a seat a few rows from the back, which may have been a good idea. It\u2019s not very tall, but it\u2019s awfully twisty, as one would expect from a GCI. And it was running pretty fast, which surprised me a bit. Just about the right length, and some decent air pops. I\u2019d put it in the upper half of GCI\u2019s, but not a standout.","title":"American Thunder"},{"location":"coasters/2024/sixflagsstlouis/#mr-freeze-reverse-blast","text":"This was my biggest priority at this particular park, because it\u2019s a mostly unique coaster. \u201cMostly\u201d because it has a twin at Six Flags Over Texas, but that one launches trains forward, whereas this one launches backward, hence \u201cReverse Blast.\u201d I\u2019ve been on a handful of coasters lately that feature spikes where the train stops and reverses direction. Generally speaking, I\u2019ve found that reversing up the spike is preferable, but on this occasion, with a coaster I\u2019d never ridden before, I think I would have preferred going forward up the spike, because it\u2019s a little less scary, in my opinion. I was worried about a line for this one, as it\u2019s a shuttle coaster, and it sometimes has reliability issues, but I needn\u2019t have been. The park was worried about it too, once upon a time, because the queue is absolutely massive. But at this moment, it was so empty that I had a hard time following where to go. I did get a good view of the ride, which really isn\u2019t all that long, and decided that it wasn\u2019t as tall as I feared. Of course, I should know better than to judge height or speed when I\u2019m on the ground, but I never learn. When I got to the station, there was no line at all, although it did fill gradually enough that each train was launching mostly full. The dual switch-track system for the launch is interesting from a technical perspective, but does nothing for the ride. I found the backward launch kind of intense, and taking the top hat backward, especially in the dark when I had no idea where it was, a bit nerve-wracking. The spike was no big deal, especially as it has no hold at the top, and simply drops the train once it reaches maximum height. Once I could see where I was going again, the forward stretch was no big deal at all, possibly even a bit short. The second time through the top hat had an unexpected loss of momentum right near the end, leading to some surprise hang-time, but that was kind of cool. I\u2019d ride it again sometime, but I had other things to do right then.","title":"Mr. Freeze Reverse Blast"},{"location":"coasters/2024/sixflagsstlouis/#pandemonium","text":"At this point, it was pretty dark, and the Haunt atmospherics were in full effect, which meant a lot of dry ice.

They\u2019ve got a big arcade, four different mini-golf courses, and a handful of rides, which are more than can really fit in such a small space. The appeal for me was that both coasters at the park are from Hopkins, and since Hopkins only ever built seven, with four still operating, that seemed like a rare get. However, Hopkins coasters are known for being a tad eccentric, so I was curious about that. Most of the center is open all day, but the coasters only open at 5pm on weekdays. Fortunately, I had other touristy stuff to do that day, so I arrived at the park just after 5. The heat was extreme that day, somewhere around 104, and I hoped that the temperature might have dropped in the evening. Unfortunately, there isn\u2019t really any significant cooling until well after dark. I foolishly paid for an \u201cextreme pass,\u201d which includes unlimited rides, a round of mini-golf, and an hour of unlimited arcade games.

Patriot The larger of the two coasters seemed to be having some issues, so I went to visit Patriot, once I was able to find it. The stats for Patriot aren\u2019t impressive; maybe 45 feet high. It\u2019s definitely a family coaster, and on the tame end of those. It\u2019s also short, but to compensate, it goes around twice for each cycle. When I got there, there were a handful of people riding at the front, but no line at all, so I hopped in the back car. I wish there was something to report, but there really isn\u2019t. There\u2019s a curved drop, and a helix with maybe a hint of forces, but that\u2019s about all. Since it goes around twice, I really couldn\u2019t see any point in riding again. Desert Storm Although this coaster\u2019s name betrays its early-90s origins, there\u2019s nothing about military action in the theming; the trains are vaguely Arabian and sparkly, and the track is white with green supports. This thing is really tightly wound up inside the park, with an elevated station, so most of the track doesn\u2019t come near the ground. There\u2019s a twisted drop, because it has no other choice, and a couple of vertical loops. These loops are\u2026kinda funky. Even looking at them from off-ride, you can see they\u2019re not the right shape. They\u2019re too round, not clothoid, and the exit is at a different elevation than the entrance. They\u2019re also really wide, but you have to be standing right under them to notice. The train is long, and I didn\u2019t go for the very last car, but I was toward the back. There was a distinct sense of getting yanked through the second half of each loop; I can only imagine what it\u2019s like in the back car. There\u2019s also a weird upward helix for some reason.

I didn\u2019t see anyone actually golfing, and I couldn\u2019t talk myself into playing mini-golf by myself, so I just left.

Even though the Halloween season is typically busy, I didn't want to pass on the opportunity. Once I arrived, it became clear that Sunday would be a lovely fall day, and the park would be absolutely slammed. Against my better judgement, I decided to purchase a flash pass, or I'd have no hope of getting on the new 2025 ride that was my main goal. Once I\u2019d made that decision, I figured \u201cgo big or go home\u201d and bought the Platinum variety. I\u2019ve made mention in the past of how having a season pass changes your behavior. Well, having a skip-the-line that works on just about everything, all the time, changes it even more. No strategizing, no prioritizing, just ride whatever you want whenever you want. And because it\u2019s the future now, instead of being a dongle or a wristwatch, it\u2019s a phone app. Pick a ride, get a QR code, and then get in line whenever. I had a bit of trouble finding a couple of the Flash pass entrances, but other than that, it was smooth. Since I was staying at a nearby hotel, I easily arrived by 10:30 for an 11:00 opening. Unfortunately, I was initially turned away at the gate when they didn't acknowledge my pass. As best I can tell, my 2026 pass isn't properly active yet because I haven't been to Great Adventure. Customer service hooked me up, though, and I got inside pretty quick. X-flight Wrath of Rakshasa was my highest priority, but the flash pass app was reporting it as closed. That wasn\u2019t quite true; it was open to standby riders, who spilled way down the midway, but the express lane was closed. Probably a good idea, really. X-flight is right nearby, so I popped that up on my app and zipped right in. It turns out that the express line joins the main one before reaching the platform, so I was able to queue for the front row without any guilt. I'm really glad I did too, because I think wing coasters are much more fun from the front. X-flight is small compared to the other wings, but I think that works to its advantage. It\u2019s compact, much in the same way Batman is compact, and if near misses are your thing on wing coasters (which they are, for me), X-flight has plenty of them, nice and tight. I\u2019m not fooled by the effects anymore, but the keyhole and subsequent elements are a lot of fun from the front. I also made sure to have a good look around, and I think X-flight may have the best view from the lift of any coaster in the park. Raging Bull Raging Bull isn\u2019t your typical B&M hyper, but hypers are still my favorite kind of coaster, so that balances. Raging Bull had also been closed for a while, and I assumed it wouldn\u2019t re-open this year, but it did. So I thought I should repay its kindness by re-riding it. Gotta say, the new paint job looks really snazzy. The colors are the same, but the orange and purple are vibrant. As for the ride itself, I waited a bit to get the back row, outside seat, and was rewarded appropriately. I somehow forgot about the B&M pre-drop, but the back seat nearly leaps off the main drop because of it. And far from turning into an i305-type twister, there\u2019s still a couple good moments of airtime in there. I\u2019m still going to prefer nice sustained airtime in a hyper, but Raging Bull is fun from time to time because it\u2019s different. American Eagle American Eagle, for some reason, isn\u2019t covered by the Flash pass. Maybe there\u2019s nowhere to put the lane, with the queue being mostly made of bridges. Anyway, I didn\u2019t know at first if it was going to be running, but the app said it was, if opening late. Without the pass, I figured I should grab that early, plus there are always rumors that this ride will be shut down or RMC\u2019d or something, so I wanted to make sure I rode it. They were only running one train, the red side, so technically I got another credit if I counted them that way, which I don\u2019t. Fortunately, the wait was barely anything. As with the two Racer coasters, I found the straightaway part to be fairly pleasant, with a little bit of air courtesy of the ride ops not stapling me (the ops had a light touch on the restraints all day, which I appreciated). The massive helix remains a bit tough to take, but I knew it was coming this time. I wished for some air on the return trip, but didn\u2019t get it. And there\u2019s a second helix near the end that I completely forgot about. As a ride, it was fine, nothing too special, but I\u2019m glad to revisit it. Goliath I was trying not to get too far away from Rakshasa, but Goliath is an RMC, and it called to me. I snagged the very back row, which I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve done before. I also tried to concentrate a bit on the elements other than the stall. The first turnaround really isn\u2019t anything special by RMC standards, although it looks impressive. But the second one, the underflip into a dive turn, that\u2019s pretty special. It\u2019s got more hang time to it than I remembered, and I chanced to look up (relative to me, anyway) into that huge lattice of wood as the dive was happening; that was pretty special. And of course the stall rules, but that means the ride is over. It\u2019s a shame to call any RMC \u201clesser,\u201d but this one is just great, not mind-blowing. Wrath of Rakshasa My patience was rewarded (as much as patience means anything when you\u2019ve got a Flash pass) and Rakshasa opened for flash-passing just after noon. One thing I have to say about this ride is that it\u2019s visually impressive. The deep blue of the track is such a contrast to everything around it, and it\u2019s right in the middle, so it feels like you can see it from anywhere. I noticed that when you\u2019re near X-Flight\u2019s entrance, you can see five different coasters at once, and Rakshasa is huge and blue and anchors the middle nicely. After surrendering my phone to the traveling loose items bin (still cool, if over-engineered), I ended up in row 1, on the far right seat. I don\u2019t know why I always get an end seat on dive coasters, but I do. Which meant I was about as far over the drop as one can get. The hang didn\u2019t bother me; in fact, I was slightly disappointed that the view isn\u2019t all that great. But I suppose I should\u2019ve expected that when you\u2019re in the middle of the view. I got a bit of air on the drop, despite the vest restraint, so that made me happy. I didn\u2019t count the rest of the inversions, but they seemed to consist mostly of rolls, which I liked, being on the outside. It\u2019s also tightly wound around itself, which is impressive when you\u2019re riding and from the pathways. Unfortunately, the reports of a B&M rattle on this brand-new coaster are accurate. It wasn\u2019t horrible, just a shimmy that really shouldn\u2019t be there on a brand-new ride. I suspect if I\u2019d been in the middle of the row, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to detect it. In short, my expectations for this one new credit weren\u2019t all that high, and they were mostly met. I wasn\u2019t too upset that my Flash pass was limited to a single go-round. Demon I rode Demon because it was right there, and because last time I\u2019d been amused by just how hard it was trying. I don\u2019t know if any of the queue got removed during Rakshasa\u2019s construction, but Demon now seems a bit overshadowed and not as cute as I\u2019d found it previously. In fact, I found it to be a bog-standard Arrow, with nasty restraints, a couple of dull loops, and two corkscrews that seem to be barely off the ground. I was also subjected to a bunch of teenagers in the car behind over-acting and shrieking in a highly annoying manner, so I was happy to get off. Viper I had a nice quesadilla for lunch over in the Southwest section, right by Viper\u2019s entrance, so I felt like I owed it a ride. The previous time I rode this was unpleasant, so I was looking for redemption. I made sure not to get a wheel seat, and I went for the next-to-last car rather than the very last, both of which may have helped. As a result, I found it to be just OK. Too much time is spent on unenjoyable turns, and the drops aren\u2019t really that impressive. Any hopes I had for airtime were unfulfilled, even with a loose restraint. Not exactly a redemption ride, but I\u2019ll move it up from \u201cbad\u201d to \u201cnot bad,\u201d so that\u2019s something. Maxx Force It was getting toward mid-afternoon now, the crowds were getting even denser, and I was starting to think I\u2019d hit the last few big rides and then bail. So Maxx Force was next. The standby line was nuts, but Flash pass wasn\u2019t too bad. I went for a middle car because I honestly don\u2019t care on this ride, and was joined by a woman enthusiast of about my own age, who seemed to be having a very fun day, so that was a bright spot. I was slightly distracted when the launch hit, and it hit hard, which I know it does, but wow. The next thing I knew, we were zipping through the roll and it\u2019s done. I still maintain that it\u2019s an excellent half of a ride, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ever going to change my opinion. After that, I decided it was time for Batman and Superman, although I wasn\u2019t feeling too motivated, as they\u2019re both clones I\u2019ve ridden many times before. I noticed that Batman\u2019s queue was stuffed, all the way back into the \u201cGotham park\u201d area, something I hadn\u2019t seen in many years. The flash pass queue joined up with the main one just before the steam tunnel, which skips a lot of the line, but still leaves the entire building portion of the queue. As I was standing at the bottom of the stairs, waiting for the line to move \u2013 it didn\u2019t \u2013 I recalled multiple times waiting in the corrugated steel corridor sweating to death (which wouldn\u2019t have happened today, since it was fairly temperate) and the times I got stuck with a group of screaming middle-schoolers echoing down that steam pipe (which there was also no sign of today), and I felt a powerful urge to bail, so I did. And snagged my hoodie on a fence on the way out, tearing it, to my annoyance. And although I probably could have recovered the afternoon from that point, the crowds were so crowded that I just decided to call it a day. Not my favorite trip to Great America, and not my cheapest either, with the cost of the Flash pass, but I rode a lot more with it than I would have without, so I think that was worth it.","title":"Great America"},{"location":"coasters/2025/greatamerica/#six-flags-great-america","text":"Visited: October 26, 2025 Attending: Just Brian My company had an off-site meeting in Chicago during the last week of October, so I decided to go out a couple of days early and hit up Great America. Even though the Halloween season is typically busy, I didn't want to pass on the opportunity. Once I arrived, it became clear that Sunday would be a lovely fall day, and the park would be absolutely slammed. Against my better judgement, I decided to purchase a flash pass, or I'd have no hope of getting on the new 2025 ride that was my main goal. Once I\u2019d made that decision, I figured \u201cgo big or go home\u201d and bought the Platinum variety. I\u2019ve made mention in the past of how having a season pass changes your behavior. Well, having a skip-the-line that works on just about everything, all the time, changes it even more. No strategizing, no prioritizing, just ride whatever you want whenever you want. And because it\u2019s the future now, instead of being a dongle or a wristwatch, it\u2019s a phone app. Pick a ride, get a QR code, and then get in line whenever. I had a bit of trouble finding a couple of the Flash pass entrances, but other than that, it was smooth. Since I was staying at a nearby hotel, I easily arrived by 10:30 for an 11:00 opening. Unfortunately, I was initially turned away at the gate when they didn't acknowledge my pass. As best I can tell, my 2026 pass isn't properly active yet because I haven't been to Great Adventure. Customer service hooked me up, though, and I got inside pretty quick.","title":"Six Flags Great America"},{"location":"coasters/2025/greatamerica/#x-flight","text":"Wrath of Rakshasa was my highest priority, but the flash pass app was reporting it as closed. That wasn\u2019t quite true; it was open to standby riders, who spilled way down the midway, but the express lane was closed. Probably a good idea, really. X-flight is right nearby, so I popped that up on my app and zipped right in. It turns out that the express line joins the main one before reaching the platform, so I was able to queue for the front row without any guilt. I'm really glad I did too, because I think wing coasters are much more fun from the front. X-flight is small compared to the other wings, but I think that works to its advantage. It\u2019s compact, much in the same way Batman is compact, and if near misses are your thing on wing coasters (which they are, for me), X-flight has plenty of them, nice and tight. I\u2019m not fooled by the effects anymore, but the keyhole and subsequent elements are a lot of fun from the front. I also made sure to have a good look around, and I think X-flight may have the best view from the lift of any coaster in the park.","title":"X-flight"},{"location":"coasters/2025/greatamerica/#raging-bull","text":"Raging Bull isn\u2019t your typical B&M hyper, but hypers are still my favorite kind of coaster, so that balances. Raging Bull had also been closed for a while, and I assumed it wouldn\u2019t re-open this year, but it did. So I thought I should repay its kindness by re-riding it. Gotta say, the new paint job looks really snazzy. The colors are the same, but the orange and purple are vibrant. As for the ride itself, I waited a bit to get the back row, outside seat, and was rewarded appropriately. I somehow forgot about the B&M pre-drop, but the back seat nearly leaps off the main drop because of it. And far from turning into an i305-type twister, there\u2019s still a couple good moments of airtime in there. I\u2019m still going to prefer nice sustained airtime in a hyper, but Raging Bull is fun from time to time because it\u2019s different.","title":"Raging Bull"},{"location":"coasters/2025/greatamerica/#american-eagle","text":"American Eagle, for some reason, isn\u2019t covered by the Flash pass. Maybe there\u2019s nowhere to put the lane, with the queue being mostly made of bridges. Anyway, I didn\u2019t know at first if it was going to be running, but the app said it was, if opening late. Without the pass, I figured I should grab that early, plus there are always rumors that this ride will be shut down or RMC\u2019d or something, so I wanted to make sure I rode it. They were only running one train, the red side, so technically I got another credit if I counted them that way, which I don\u2019t. Fortunately, the wait was barely anything. As with the two Racer coasters, I found the straightaway part to be fairly pleasant, with a little bit of air courtesy of the ride ops not stapling me (the ops had a light touch on the restraints all day, which I appreciated). The massive helix remains a bit tough to take, but I knew it was coming this time. I wished for some air on the return trip, but didn\u2019t get it. And there\u2019s a second helix near the end that I completely forgot about.

The first turnaround really isn\u2019t anything special by RMC standards, although it looks impressive. But the second one, the underflip into a dive turn, that\u2019s pretty special. It\u2019s got more hang time to it than I remembered, and I chanced to look up (relative to me, anyway) into that huge lattice of wood as the dive was happening; that was pretty special.

I am terribly jealous. I took a week off from work in mid-August, and asked if they wanted to go to HersheyPark. I fully expected them to say that they were theme-parked out for the summer, which was fine by me. I had several free tickets, so it was no huge loss if they didn\u2019t want to go. However, their experience in Florida only increased their coaster appetite, and they wanted to go on some that they hadn\u2019t been on before, so they agreed. We got started a bit later than usual, arriving at the park at around 11:30. The super-premier parking was full already, but the mostly-premier parking still had spaces, so we went with that. The forecast was for low 70s and overcast, which I thought would keep the crowds down. Sadly, neither prediction turned out to be accurate. Skyrush Once we entered, we discovered that Candymonium had a 60-minute wait posted, so we took the secret Skyrush path to Comet Hollow. It turned out that Steven and Jude were excited to ride Skyrush, as they\u2019d skipped it on their previous visit. It\u2019s a fairly intense ride, so Jude was a little apprehensive, but he\u2019d just ridden Velocicoaster recently, and judged that he could handle an intense Intamin. I was willing to start with something a bit tamer, but we\u2019d taken the complimentary lockers, and Skyrush is right there, after all. After a not-terribly-long line, we filled up row 4. Kate and Jude took the center seats, and Steven and I took the wings. As always, the lift hill was remarkably fast, getting to the top almost before we knew it. I felt like I was able to get some good air on the couple of airtime moments, which is a pleasant surprise for Skyrush. I hadn\u2019t ridden with the new restraints before, and found them fairly comfortable. SooperDooper Looper After Skyrush, we went on the SooperDooper Looper, because it was right there, and we had the lockers for a while. There\u2019s really not a lot to say about the Looper in this day and age. It\u2019s still fun in that it has more elements than just the loop. After the Looper, we had a leisurely lunch at Los Tres Cubanos (?) Wildcat\u2019s Revenge Wildcat was the thing I really wanted to ride today, as I\u2019d only gotten a single ride on it in the past.

When: May, 1925 Introduction The Golden Age of Hollywood! Charlie Chaplin, Rudolph Valentino, Douglas Fairbanks, Greta Garbo, and dozens of others. The movie studios in this era include MGM, Universal, United Artists, as well as some privately owned studios, like those belonging to Chaplin and Buster Keaton. And in this case, the fictional Celestial Studios. But not everything in Hollywood is glitzy and glamorous: Many aspiring men and women have come to Hollywood to join the movie industry, only to find themselves out of luck. Often destitute, they\u2019ll take any job they can, which makes them easy marks for unscrupulous business types, whether connected to the movie industry or otherwise. Drug use and alcoholism is rampant, even though Prohibition is the law of the land. The Los Angeles police are famously corrupt in this era, and as Hollywood is far from the center of the city, the area is poorly patrolled. Many studios, especially newer ones, are funded by organized crime, some more or less openly. With so many people passing through the area, and many of those using stage names or otherwise obscuring their backgrounds, it\u2019s no wonder that people go missing and are never heard from again. Adventure Background It\u2019s true that people go missing in Hollywood all the time, but sometimes they\u2019re missed. Aspiring actress Ellie Mae Westcott has lost her brother, Billy Joe, and is desperate for help to find him. Everybody else thinks that Billy Joe went home, or left town with a girl, but Ellie Mae doesn\u2019t believe that of her brother. With nowhere else to turn, she\u2019ll ask the PCs for help. Billy Joe and others are going missing because Celestial Studios is harboring a group of Weeping Angels, an offshoot of the ones seen in New York in the episode \u201cThe Angels Take Manhattan.\u201d Alastair Wainwright, owner of Celestial, has an uneasy alliance with the Angels: they can remove his competition, in exchange for shelter and a regular source of \u201cfood.\u201d However, Celestial hasn\u2019t successfully made any films yet, and the Angels have to supplement their diet by doing some hunting on their own. This is giving Celestial a creepy reputation, making people not want to work there, which perpetuates the cycle. The Angels\u2019 long-term plan, which Wainwright doesn\u2019t know, is to appear in the background of films distributed around the country and around the world. Since \u201cthat which holds the image of an Angel is also an Angel,\u201d they\u2019ll quickly have access to all the food they could possibly want. Running the Adventure \u201cCity of Angels\u201d is designed as a two-part story. In Act One, the PCs will take in the sights of Hollywood for a bit, and eventually encounter Ellie Mae, or find another hook to the missing people. Some light detective work will turn up some clues that point toward something funny going on at Celestial Studios, driving the PCs to investigate. With some careful pacing, you can have the PCs discover the Angels right at the end of Act One, for a great cliffhanger. The primary responsibilities for the GM in Act One are to control the pace and set the atmosphere. Hollywood by day is sun-washed and hot, full of beautiful people and colorful characters all engaged in the business of telling made-up stories. Even if Ellie May hasn\u2019t found stardom yet, she\u2019s sure it\u2019s just around the corner. The effect should be of a magical place where anything is possible. Even the speakeasy (if you use that set) should be a \u201cCheers\u201d-like saloon operating more or less openly, clean and friendly, a place where you\u2019d want to spend your lunch hour or some time after work with friends. This sets up the contrast to Celestial Studios, which should be dark and creepy, as much as possible like the Wester Drumlins house from \u201cBlink.\u201d Hopefully the PCs investigate at night, but even if they manage to get in during daylight, emphasize that the place is understaffed, full of shadowy corners. The various buildings and warehouses are close together, forming a network of narrow alleys. Random sets and equipment make it easy to get lost. The warehouse where the Angels are found is full of old broken props and bric-a-brac, with dim light casting strange shadows everywhere. Involving the Characters If the party includes any version of the Doctor, it\u2019s a safe bet they\u2019ll want to go explore Hollywood. As an incurable name-dropper, the Doctor would likely want to check in on their friends Charlie Chaplin or Buster Keaton, only to be disappointed to learn they\u2019re not in town right now. If the party doesn\u2019t include the Doctor, but includes any Earthlings, especially ones from the modern era, the urge to explore Hollywood will likely be enough on its own. Even future humans have likely heard of Hollywood and its role in 20th Century culture. If the party doesn\u2019t include anyone who\u2019s been to Earth before, a policeman can wander along soon after the party lands and chase them away from the sign. In this era, it\u2019s on private property, and access is restricted. The policeman can send them down the hill toward town. Act One: Missing Persons The characters may immediately realize where they are, and when (the Golden Age of Hollywood), which may be sufficient motivation to want to explore, see some studios, meet some early stars, maybe get cast as extras in a movie. Fun map of Hollywood 1928 If the characters are uninterested, or don\u2019t know enough to realize where they are (because of their background), Officer Colin Thompson can chase them away off the hill. \u201cHollywoodland\u201d at the time referred to a real estate development further down the hill; the sign was an advertisement. From the sign\u2019s location, the characters can proceed directly south to Mulholland Drive and down into Hollywood proper, or they can take a safer trail to the east, into Griffith Park and head south from there. Either way, it\u2019s about five miles to Hollywood proper, and will take a couple of hours to walk because of the steep terrain. Griffith Observatory isn\u2019t there yet (it\u2019ll be built by the WPA in 1933 and open in 1935, if you want to tweak the timeline). Griffith Park is an existing wilderness area in this era, with the Griffith Park Zoo a few miles south of where the current zoo stands. The land occupied by the modern zoo is an aerodrome in this era. Various Studios exist on Sunset Boulevard, including Warner Brothers, Fox, and Universal not far away. There are a number of smaller studios lost to history, including, for this story, the fictional Celestial Studios. Let the players explore for a while; keep the pace light and the descriptions up-beat. This is Hollywood, and it\u2019s fun and exciting. If players have something specific they want to see, you can provide it, or a good reason why they just missed it. (Both Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton are shooting on location right now, and not in town.) They might find a \u201cmap of the stars\u201d that shows where the various studios are. If they poke around enough, they might wander by Our Lady of Angels church, where Reverend Gainsworth is out front preaching about the immorality of alcohol, moving pictures, corruption, women\u2019s hem-lines; take your pick. He won\u2019t pay any special attention to the PCs at this time, except maybe warn them to mind the state of their immortal souls. Meeting Ellie Mae Eventually the PCs will run into Ellie Mae and Rupert , having a discussion on the street. You can place this discussion in any geographic area; you just need it to happen at the point in the story where the players\u2019 enthusiasm for Hollywood is starting to wane. The discussion is heated enough for raised voices (allowing the PCs to overhear), but it\u2019s not a full-blown argument. Ellie Mae is concerned about her brother Billy Joe, who\u2019s been missing for three days. Rupert assumes Billy Joe has either gone home or run off with a girl; either way, he doesn\u2019t think there\u2019s much mystery here. He wants Ellie Mae to concentrate on learning her lines for an audition in a few days. When the discussion starts, Rupert refers to Ellie Mae by her stage name, Rita, and Ellie will have a fairly cosmopolitan accent. As the discussion gets heated, Ellie\u2019s accent may slip into an Alabama drawl, and Rupert may slip up and call her \u201cEllie.\u201d If you\u2019re up for an acting challenge, you can try to imitate this, or if not, simply tell the players when her accent changes. The players may jump in and offer to help at this point. If not, Ellie gets frustrated enough to storm away from Rupert, bumping straight into the PCs. Depending on how the PCs react to her, she may try to keep her stage persona for a little bit, or immediately introduce herself as Ellie Mae in her natural accent. With nowhere else to turn, she\u2019ll ask the PCs for help. Lunch and Explanations Once the PCs are hooked, she\u2019ll suggest going to Charlie\u2019s speakeasy for a bite to eat and a place to sit down while she explains. Once there, she\u2019ll tell the PCs the following information: She\u2019s from Alabama, but wants to be in movies. Her brother Billy Joe is a year older than her, and encouraged her to follow her dream, so they both came out to Hollywood, without their parents\u2019 approval. Billy Joe doesn\u2019t seem to have leading-man potential, so he does odd jobs as a day laborer, and as an extra when he can get it. He wants Ellie to realize her dream, so he\u2019s supporting both of them. Ellie lives at a boarding house for aspiring women actresses. Billy Joe stayed at a hostel for laborers; basically a flop-house. They met Rupert not long after they arrived. Connections in this town are everything, and Rupert is the only one they\u2019ve got. Unfortunately, Rupert isn\u2019t terribly successful, and is banking on Ellie\u2019s star power to boost both their careers. Despite rumors of how men behave in Hollywood, Rupert has never been inappropriate toward Ellie; he\u2019s absolutely professional, and she trusts him. Billy Joe disappeared three days ago, with no word, and no message. Ellie thinks this is very unlike him. She knows that Rupert believes he ran off with a girl, but Ellie knows he wouldn\u2019t leave her like that. Rupert has arranged an audition at Celestial Studios in the next few days. It\u2019s the best lead he or Ellie have had yet, and he wants her concentrating on that. Basil and Rick are also in the speakeasy, and Charlie is behind the bar. Either Basil or Rick is likely to stick their nose into this conversation, depending on how you want to play it. Basil wants to show off that he\u2019s got connections, and will play coy until the PCs buy him a drink. Rick is more sympathetic to Ellie, but also more likely to agree with Rupert\u2019s supposition. Play the dialog however seems most fun and natural to you, but the PCs should learn the following: Billy Joe has been seen talking with people known to be involved in organized crime. Billy Joe believes that Wainwright has mob ties, and thinks he has enough leverage to blackmail Wainwright into hiring Ellie and Rupert. Billy Joe was seen around Celestial Studios a few days ago, but that\u2019s the last anyone has seen of him. If the players investigate further, or do really well in their interactions in the bar, they may learn that Billy Joe isn\u2019t the only disappearance. It\u2019s hard to tell in Hollywood, because people come and go all the time, and half of them aren\u2019t using their real names or backgrounds. But several of the disappearances are either people who had connections to Celestial, or were in the geographic area. If any of the NPCs have given it much thought, they\u2019d assume that Wainwright\u2019s supposed mob connections allow him to order people \u201cdisappeared.\u201d Who\u2019s Who Colin Thompson , local police. Stereotypical Irish cop. 40s, balding, bit paunchy. Sweats a lot because he\u2019s an Irishman in Southern California. If you need someone to chase the PCs away from the sign, or to provide info and directions once they\u2019re in town, Colin\u2019s your guy. He\u2019s a beat cop, but not likely to chase anyone down, because he\u2019s not in good enough shape for that. Can be on the take if the story needs him to be. Won\u2019t investigate Celestial if asked; there are too many rumors about that place and its owner. Ellie Mae Westcott , aspiring actress looking for her brother. Early to mid 20s, tall, thin but shapely, with blonde hair she wears in a stylish flapper\u2019s cut. Goes by \u201cRita Swanson\u201d as a stage name. She\u2019s got girl-next-door charm, and when she wants to, she\u2019s got poise and presence that can knock most people back on their heels. When she\u2019s in stage mode, she has a mostly neutral accent with just a hint of New York in it. When she forgets, or when she\u2019s around people she trusts, the act drops and she\u2019s a gentle Southern girl with a pronounced Alabama accent. She\u2019s got Cavanaugh\u2019s patronage, and despite appearances, the relationship is entirely professional. That association is keeping her from working for any other studios. She lives at a local boarding house for aspiring actresses. Rupert Cavanaugh , a director who believes Ellie Mae has potential. He\u2019s in his early 30s, slender, heavily Pomaded black hair. A sharp dresser, although on closer inspection, his clothes have seen better days. He\u2019s had fallings-out with other studio bosses, and learned the hard way not to have opinions. He\u2019s trying to get a job with Wainwright now because he wants to keep working. May provide some info, but not willing to take any risks. Despite what the PC\u2019s may assume, doesn\u2019t have any ill intentions toward Ellie Mae. He\u2019s gay, but that\u2019s one thing you can\u2019t be in Hollywood at this time, so he doesn\u2019t want anyone to know. One of the other victims was his lover, but he\u2019s keeping his head down about that too. Basil Oakhurst , aspiring screenwriter, stereotypical English snot. Mid-30s, but looks older. Starting to bald, doesn\u2019t care. Extremely thin, nose like the prow of a ship. Wears tweed. Can be found at the speakeasy, with his portable typewriter and a drink. He must have money back home, because he hasn\u2019t sold a script yet, but can afford to keep drinking. Looks down on everybody, including himself, but has a soft spot for Ellie Mae because she\u2019s genuine. Won\u2019t talk about himself, but is a good source of gossip about literally anything else. A good source for revealing that Billy tried to blackmail Wainwright. Charlie Wu , a bartender at the local speakeasy. He\u2019s from Fresno, Jack. Doesn\u2019t want trouble in his place. Pays off the cops regularly so he can operate more-or-less in the open. Sells sandwiches to patrons who haven\u2019t had a lot to eat lately. He\u2019s no soft touch; any one of these shmoes could be the next Clark Gable. Rick McHenry , newspaper reporter. 20s, skinny, disheveled, cheap suit. Needs a shave. He\u2019s here to get an interview with Buster Keaton, but has been blocked at every turn. He\u2019s pretending he\u2019s with the Chicago Tribune, but he\u2019s actually a stringer. Another good source of information if the PCs need it. Reverend Horton Gainesworth , an elderly preacher, sole staff of Our Lady of the Angels. The epitome of the word \u201cgrizzled.\u201d Tall, but stooped now. Uses a cane, but just as much for shaking at people as for support. Black priest garb, none too clean. Thinning gray hair that needs a brush; he\u2019s either trying to grow a beard unsuccessfully, or he really needs a shave. Can often be found on the front steps of the church, fulminating about sin and how depraved the town is getting. A known source of refuge for those who have nowhere else to go, but that doesn\u2019t mean he has to be nice about it. Spoilers: Rev. Gainesworth is actually Billy Joe Westcott, Ellie May\u2019s brother. He was born in 1902, came to Hollywood with Ellie Mae, got angel-zapped to 1865, and simply stayed in the area until his sister showed up. He appears mad, which he may be, after all he\u2019s been through, but he\u2019s also not sure what to do without disrupting the timeline. Having all sorts of mixed-up feelings about contacting his sister again. Knows a lot about the Angels, but won\u2019t reveal himself to Ellie Mae or the PCs until after their first encounter with the Angels. Trying to save his younger self or stop the PCs from encountering the Angels will result in a paradox, and he\u2019s been warned not to do that (by the PCs if the opportunity arises; by a strange man in a bow tie if not). Alastair Wainwright , owner of Celestial Studios. Mid 50s, stereotypical rich guy, white fringe of hair, thin mustache that he thinks makes him look better than it does. Overweight for the era, more \u201cround\u201d by modern standards. Finely dressed, a couple of expensive-looking rings. Cigar smoker. Alastair knows what the Angels are and has an idea of what they do. How he found out and exactly what he\u2019s getting out of the deal are best left vague. He knows that the Angels want to be filmed and distributed, but doesn\u2019t know what that will mean. At the moment, while he appears to be working on a few movies, he\u2019s spending most of his energy on developing new, lighter cameras and film, with some vague assist from the Angels. If anybody questions him or pokes too hard into his business, they tend to disappear. This has led to assumptions of organized crime connections, but it\u2019s actually the Angels. Gabe Hernandez , props wrangler at Celestial Studios. 40s, short and stocky, male-pattern baldness, nervous expression. Wears a work shirt and overalls. If the players need an excuse to explore the props room once they\u2019re inside the studio, they can overhear Gabe arguing with Wainwright. Gabe is upset that the previous props master left, and doesn\u2019t want to go in the storage room. Wainwright tells him he\u2019ll go or be fired. After, Gabe will wring his hands in the hallway for a while, then run off. Guido and Luigi , thugs working for Wainwright, under orders to prevent anybody unauthorized poking around the studio. They believe Wainwright\u2019s lie that he\u2019s working on revolutionary tech, but they don\u2019t really care all that much. Neither of them talk much; they\u2019re giant slabs of muscle in ill-fitting suits. The Victims The following people are among the missing. With enough investigation, the PCs can find out their names and roughly when they vanished, but no more than that. Odds are the PCs won\u2019t find out about them at all, but these are hooks to point the PCs to Celestial if any are needed. Billy Joe Westcott , Ellie May\u2019s brother. He was zapped while trying to blackmail Wainwright into a job for Ellie Mae, over Wainwright\u2019s mob connections. Antonio Juarez , waiter, Cavanaugh's lover. Zapped in an alley behind the restaurant where he worked. Grover , no other name, a drifter. Zapped sleeping behind Celestial Studios. Mary Harbison , aspiring actress. Lived in the same dorm where Ellie Mae lives now, but not at the same time. The other girls have rumors about her. Zapped while on a screen test. Mac Malone , former propmaster at Celestial. Zapped because he got too inquisitive about the angels. He\u2019s an anomaly, because he\u2019s not someone who would just up and leave his job. Had gambling debts, though. Investigating Celestial Studios All the clues should be pointing the PCs to Celestial Studios at this point. They\u2019ll need some way to investigate: They can wait until nightfall and simply break in. If they have any kind of technology from later than 1925, this shouldn\u2019t be difficult. Ellie Mae won\u2019t want to accompany them unless specifically requested. She\u2019s never been inside and has no information that would help. She\u2019ll stay at her boarding house. They could wait and try to accompany Ellie and Rupert to the audition. This will take some explaining, as Ellie shouldn\u2019t have much of an entourage at this point, and Rupert won\u2019t want any extraneous people there who might screw up his chances. They could fake a legitimate business reason to be there during daylight. They might pretend to be reporters who want to interview Wainwright, actors or screenwriters who want to talk to him, or maybe just laborers looking for a job. If they try any of these, Guido will block them at the front gate and inform them that Mr. Wainwright is occupied and not seeing visitors. The PCs could try any number of Doctor-Who -ish solutions to bluff, charm, or distract Guido, but it\u2019ll be difficult; this is his job, after all. Overpowering him is near impossible, and would be noticed on the street at mid-day. You can tweak the circumstances to encourage the PCs to come back at night to break in. Inside Celestial, the PCs can find the following: The back of the studio is a solid wooden fence along a narrow alley, with a swinging wooden gate wide enough for flatbed trucks. This is where the studio takes its shipments, but it\u2019s also the perfect place to break in, either by picking the lock or scaling the fence. Immediately inside the back gate is a dirt lot where loading and unloading takes place. During the day, there will be some laborers moving crates around. At night, it\u2019s empty. There are several warehouse-type buildings around the lot (except for the side against the fence), with narrow alleys between them, shadowed even during the day. Wainwright\u2019s office is at the front of the complex, facing the street. During the day, Wainwright will be here. He knows about the Angels and their plan, but doesn\u2019t know how catastrophic that would be. He\u2019ll tell the PCs they have no business here, and if they go to the police, no one will believe them. If they try to get rough, he\u2019ll sic Guido and Luigi on them. At night, Wainwright won\u2019t be here, but the PCs can find in the paperwork: Evidence of movie distribution deals, still being negotiated Evidence of payments from New York shell companies including Grayle Collections, Heavenly Produce, and Winter Quay No evidence of organized crime connections A screening room: basically a rectangular room with some chairs, a screen, and a projector. Before the cliffhanger, the room is empty with no film on the projector. A soundstage, where filming is taking place, or done for the day, depending on the time. There\u2019s a large, heavy camera set up pointing at a stage that has some set dressing on it: some fake trees, a couple of tombstones, and a crumbling wall with ivy on it. There\u2019s a plinth that might hold a statue, currently empty. Film storage: A room full of cans containing film reels. On a successful Knowledge roll, a character with a background in chemistry or film history will know this is early celluloid, which is extremely flammable. Near the props storage during the day, Gabe Hernandez. He got promoted on Mac\u2019s disappearance, but he\u2019s terrified to go near the props storage again. He\u2019ll help if the PCs are kind to him. Props storage: This is a large warehouse full of stage dressing, and essentially junk. If it\u2019s night, entice the PCs in here by having the door open, and a flickering light from inside. Inside, there\u2019s a single bulb casting shadows everywhere. If it\u2019s daytime, a few dirty windows near the roof-line let in murky daylight. Either way, there\u2019s enough light to make out what\u2019s in here: Bits of wall made of wood, but painted to look like brick or stone; fake plants with cloth leaves; a chariot with a broken wheel; some statues; a few large urns painted to look Greek; the base of a fountain with no water. Once the PCs enter props storage, mention the \u201cstatues of various figures\u201d in the middle of the description. If the PCs investigate further, they\u2019ll notice that most of the statues are cheap plaster. Some are Greek heroes or athletes, there\u2019s a headless Winged Victory of Samothrace, and in the back, two figures with folded wings, floor-length robes, and hands over their faces. These are the Weeping Angels, but hopefully you won\u2019t have to tell the players that, because they\u2019ll figure it out for themselves and be too busy shouting. If you can time it correctly, immediately after discovering the Angels is a great place for a cliffhanger, either ending the episode, or for a mid-session break. Act Two: Angels Among Us At this point, the PCs should have investigated Celestial far enough to find the Angels in the props storage. Now that the Angels know the PCs are there, they\u2019ll also know the PCs are time travelers, which makes them lunch. These Angels are hungry, and although attacking a group is dangerous, they\u2019ll do it if they think they\u2019re safe. If the PCs turn and run, the Angels will follow. The two Angels they\u2019ve discovered are Abigail and Charlotte. Angel Beryl is elsewhere in the props warehouse. If the PCs look carefully, they can spot her. If they try to stick around at all, Beryl will attempt to extinguish the light of the sodium bulb. As seen in \u201cBlink,\u201d an Angel can point at a light source, which causes it to flicker several times and then extinguish. With intermittent darkness, the PCs probably won\u2019t want to stick around, but if they do, one of them may get zapped. The Angels The three Angels are more or less identical, and don\u2019t have personalities to speak of. You want them to be a force of nature in this story, rather than motivated villains. As the GM, you may need to tell them apart, so I\u2019ve provided names and identifying characteristics. However, you really don\u2019t want the PCs getting close. They should be either running away, or not-blinking at the Angels. Angel Abigail - zaps people back to 1788. Has a longer nose and a crack in its right bicep. Angel Beryl - zaps people back to 1865. Has a chip out of its left wing, near the top. Angel Charlotte - zaps people back to 1654. Has a younger-looking, rounder face. If you have a large number of players, more than 4 or 5, you may want to add another Angel or two, just to make it harder for the PCs to immobilize them all at once. Similarly, if you only have one or two players, you may want to remove Angel Charlotte. Escaping Celestial If the PCs stay within Celestial, trying to investigate, the Angels will stalk them. The Angels can move pretty much wherever they want when the PCs aren\u2019t looking, so they could be behind, ahead, or down side corridors. However, there are only three, so you\u2019ll need to keep track of where they are. Make this as claustrophobic as possible. Angels can appear down the end of corridors, or inside rooms as the PCs go by. As long as the PCs keep a lookout, the Angels can\u2019t actually get them. The section \u201cDon\u2019t Blink!\u201d below provides mechanical advice on how to interact with the Angels. The Angels will generally try to herd the PCs into a place where they\u2019re cornered. However, Celestial doesn\u2019t have too many dead ends. There\u2019s lots of corridors, but they usually connect up and lead somewhere. If the PCs don\u2019t dally, watch for Angels, and generally try to get out of there, they should make it. If the PCs have time-travel tech, or even a TARDIS key, the Angels are going to want it, and they\u2019ll home in on whichever PC has it. If the PCs split up, the Angels will follow the ones with the strongest time-energy signature. If one of the PCs is a Time Lord, they\u2019re the target. If not, the Angels will be drawn to whichever PC is the furthest from their home time period. One exception, mostly because it\u2019s great for atmosphere: the screening room. If the players discovered it during Part 1, the room was empty. If they find it now, it\u2019s still empty of people, but there\u2019s a reel on the projector. If the players barricade themselves in the room, the Angels will rattle the door for a few seconds, then stop. A few seconds after that, the projector will turn on, showing a static image of the soundstage with an Angel in the center of the shot. If the PCs look away at all, the Angel will move \u201ccloser\u201d to the screen. If the PCs ignore the Angel, it\u2019ll eventually emerge from the screen. (\u201cThat which holds the image of an Angel is also an Angel.\u201d) If the PCs shut off the projector, it\u2019ll turn itself back on after a couple of seconds. If they unplug the projector, it\u2019ll still turn back on after a couple of seconds, even unplugged. Only cutting the film or removing it from the projector will stop the image. This encounter is useful to draw out the chase and give the players a chance to breathe for just a second, before ramping the tension back up and making the scene even creepier. If the PCs run off the lot and back into the city, the Angels will follow, but not too far. Even in 1925, there are streetlights, and it\u2019s not so late yet that the Angels won\u2019t be seen. Depending on where the PCs go, the Angels may appear in alleyways, but not out in the open. Don\u2019t Blink! The Doctor Who RPG rules don\u2019t give stats for Weeping Angels, and that\u2019s a good thing. These aren\u2019t baddies you can fight physically. They\u2019re faster than the PCs and impervious to harm. If the PCs try things that would normally break a stone statue, like hitting it with a hammer, they\u2019ll discover that the Angels are incredibly tough, much more than even stone. You don\u2019t want the PCs to win this through brute force; they\u2019ll need to be clever. However, the PCs should know how to freeze an Angel, or find out real quick. If you put Weeping Angels in a story, expect the players to want to not-blink at them; this is part of the fun! You want it to work, so the PCs have some recourse, but you also need the players to know that simply declaring that they keep an Angel immobilized by staring at it is tougher than it sounds. To keep an Angel frozen by staring at it: Awareness + Resolve. Start at difficulty 9, easy. Each round, bump the difficulty by 3. Be sure to describe the PC\u2019s sensation of their eyes getting dry, a desire to look anywhere else, and eventually the burning need to blink. Bump the difficulty by a lot if an Angel extinguishes a light or puts a lot of dust in the air. If the player succeeds, the Angel stays where it is, but the player can only move very slowly, and can\u2019t lose line of sight. If the player fails, the PC blinks and the Angel moves closer. Remember to tell the player that they can\u2019t see the Angel move. It\u2019s simply closer than it was before, in the literal blink of an eye. Especially in the beginning of the encounter, let the player have two or three failures before the Angel is close enough to touch. To spot an Angel: Awareness + Ingenuity (the standard Notice roll). Difficulty 12 if the Angel is chasing, 15 if it\u2019s hiding. Adjust the difficulty depending on the ambient light, and how much you want to ratchet the tension. To find a hiding Angel you know is there: Awareness + Subterfuge or Survival. Difficulty 18. In pitch darkness, 24. Remember: The purpose of these rules is to let the GM control the pacing and the tension, not to insta-kill the PCs just because they got a bad roll. Angel-zapping a PC will take the story in a whole new direction (see \u201cTouched by an Angel\u201d below), so it should carry some dramatic weight if it happens. If the PCs insist on continuing to investigate Celestial even knowing the Angels are there, ratchet up the threat and bring the Angels closer. You know your players and the tone you\u2019re trying to provide, so it\u2019s up to you where to set the threshold for Angel-zapping. The players may trap themselves in a corner with no way to escape. If the players decide that knowing how to freeze the Angels makes them safe, and they can continue as they were, well, you know what happens in Doctor Who to characters who get arrogant and complacent. Encountering Ellie Mae again The PCs might run to Ellie Mae\u2019s boarding house. Or they might go back to the speakeasy. Either way, they\u2019ll find Ellie there, fretting. She\u2019ll have a note from Rev Gainesworth, asking her to come to Our Lady of the Angels church, which isn\u2019t far from the studio or the boarding house. The note reads: \u201cEllie Mae \u2013 Beware the statues. Come to Our Lady of the Angels church, and I\u2019ll explain. \u2013 Rev. H. Gainesworth.\u201d Reverend Gainesworth If the PCs go with Ellie Mae to meet Rev. Gainesworth, how he reacts depends on how the PCs treat him. If the PCs are wary or aggressive, Gainesworth will get defensive, but also angry, and accuse the PCs of putting Ellie Mae in danger. If the PCs are sincere in looking for information or help, Gainesworth may waffle at first, as if he does't quite know his own mind, but eventually he'll invite everyone in, saying that they're safe within the church. Once Gainesworth calms down, he\u2019ll fill the party in on any Angel lore they don\u2019t know about. If asked how he knows about the Angels, he\u2019ll be vague. If pressed directly, he\u2019ll say he was told not to say too much, so as not to rip the universe in half. But the Angels need to be stopped, and within the next couple of days. The PCs may realize who Gainesworth is, or at least that he got his knowledge by being a victim. If not, he\u2019ll act oddly around Ellie Mae. He\u2019ll avoid addressing her directly, or even looking at her. If the PCs figure it out, he\u2019ll admit it, but he didn\u2019t know what to do about Ellie. He\u2019s been following instructions up to this point, but now that he\u2019s here, he feels uncertain. Meeting Ellie again after 60 years is too much for him. Key points that Gainesworth needs to convey to the PCs: - The image of an Angel is itself an Angel. - If the penny doesn\u2019t drop for the PCs, he can explain that the Angels want to be filmed, reproduced, and distributed. - There\u2019s no good way to destroy an Angel, but if they drop it someplace where it won\u2019t be discovered, it\u2019ll probably starve to death. He\u2019ll suggest the ocean, a nearby ravine, or La Brea if the PCs don\u2019t come up with it themselves. Stopping the Angels There isn\u2019t really a way of destroying the Angels; you can just stop them temporarily. If the PCs can get them to look at one another, that\u2019s effective enough to go on with. The PCs can take advantage of a few ways to trick the Angels into looking at each other, or themselves: There are plenty of mirrors around, because it\u2019s a movie studio The PCs could also trick them into watching their own image on film If the PCs have the Angels immobilized (looking at each other, or just enough PCs keeping an eye on them), they\u2019ll be able to transport the Angels without too much trouble. The studio has flatbed trucks and cranes for moving large pieces of sets around. If it\u2019s not feasible to get equipment from Celestial, there are plenty of other places in Hollywood that rent equipment to studios. Don\u2019t let the plot become bogged down because the PCs can\u2019t get a truck. To get rid of them permanently, the PCs need to stick them someplace where they won\u2019t be found again for a very long time, like geological time. They could dump them in: A big ravine: There are plenty of steep canyons and dry riverbeds in the area, some of which will still be uninhabited for decades. You don\u2019t need to find a precise real-world location; just make up a cave in a canyon nearby, or have an NPC suggest it. The ocean: The Pacific is conveniently nearby, and it doesn\u2019t take long to get to an area deep enough that a few statues won\u2019t be spotted for a very long time. Keeping the Angels immobilized isn\u2019t a huge problem; somebody just has to stare at them until they sink out of sight. Stone Angels aren\u2019t known for their swimming skills. The construction site: the Hollywoodland housing development where the PCs arrived has a number of options for burying Angels. Houses in California don\u2019t have basements, but they do have foundations. Mulholland Drive and environs will one day be some of the most sought-after addresses in Hollywood. Strategically, it\u2019s not the best solution, because construction in the area, or landslides, could easily free the Angels in the future. Thematically, though, it would be fun to suggest that some of Hollywood\u2019s most famous stars live in houses built atop buried Angels. You could even use it as a hook for a sequel story. The La Brea Tar Pits: this famous Los Angeles site is only a few miles from Hollywood, making it more convenient than a ravine or the ocean. It exists in this era -- excavations started in 1913 \u2013 but it\u2019s not yet a big tourist attraction, so you can find a time when no one is around to dump some statues there. This option really takes advantage of the L.A. flavor, and makes a great image as the Angels sink slowly into the muck. Plus, the players will feel very clever if they think of this option themselves. Getting rid of the film-duplicate Angels is easy, because celluloid burns. In fact, you can get it hot enough to burn with the light from a film projector. Although a massive fire won\u2019t destroy the Angels, it will nicely take out Celestial and any remaining evidence. History doesn\u2019t record a massive fire in Hollywood at that time, but a fire big enough to put a studio out of business for good? Who\u2019s to say? Wrapping up There\u2019s not much the PCs can do to rescue Billy or any of the other victims, unless they have an extremely accurate time machine. Even then, any attempt to rescue them, especially Billy, risks ripping a hole in causality. Therefore, the ending will be bittersweet for Billy and Ellie Mae, but Billy will conclude that his sacrifice saved his sister\u2019s future, and that will be enough for him. With Celestial Studios gone, or at least shut down, Rupert and Ellie Mae will have to start over. Feel free to imagine a happy ending for them in which they\u2019re both successful. Maybe Rupert pioneers science fiction movies. Touched by an Angel What if the PCs get Angel-zapped? This is where you have to start improvising. The possibilities multiply broadly if any or all of the PCs gets zapped back in time. What they might do there, how they might communicate with the PCs in 1925, and how they get back depends greatly on who the PCs are and what abilities they have. You\u2019ll need to keep track of which Angel is which and how they get the PCs. Each time zone has a specific setting and NPCs from earlier in the game who can help. 1654 The native Tongva people occupy much of what will be Los Angeles and the Hollywood Hills. They refer to the area as Yaa, and the large village in downtown LA as Yaanga. However, there are a large number of villages scattered throughout the area (whose names are mostly lost), and the people tend to identify more with their native village than as \u201cTongva\u201d in general. The Chumash are an equally powerful and advanced tribe to the northwest, and a trading partner to the Tongva. The Tongva also occupy Catalina Island and the other islands in the bay. Spanish and Mexican explorers have reached the area by this time, but there are no permanent settlements. So the Tongva won\u2019t be surprised by pale-skinned humans wearing strange clothing. There may be a convenient Spanish explorer here (call him Diego) if the PCs don\u2019t have translator microbes. The Tongva believe in a \u201cweb of life,\u201d of which humans are just one part. They won\u2019t know about the Angels specifically, but may be convinced that the Angels are parasites on the web, and be willing to help the PCs send a message to the future. Who\u2019s here? Grover and Mac Mallone have been Angel-zapped to this period. Mac was the prop master at Celestial. Wainwright allowed an Angel to get him when Mac started asking too many questions. He can tell the PCs that something hinky was going on at Celestial Studios. Mr. Wainwright shot a lot of footage of props and scenery, but there didn\u2019t seem to be any scripts yet, or actors or directors assigned. He had acquired lots of stage dressing from a Broadway company that went bankrupt (which is how the Angels got out here from the Manhattan colony). Other people didn\u2019t want to go into props storage because it creeped them out. Mac didn\u2019t get it, but now he knows why. He\u2019s mid-40s, a smoker, and won\u2019t survive more than another couple of decades. Grover seems to be a drifter who got zapped in an alley because an Angel got hungry. However, if the PCs are stuck and need more information to progress, Grover is a GM\u2019s wild card. He can be a Time Agent, or any futuristic sort of person who could tell the PCs what the Angels are, and provide help to communicate to 1925. How can the PCs leave a message for 1925? This will be tricky, because most of the people and dwellings that are here now get wiped out. However, a few things could happen: If Grover is a Time Agent or similar, he might build a stasis cube that could leave a message someplace the PCs might find it (the construction site, the studio, the church, or buried under the Hollywood sign). Mac or Grover might be able to suggest a relic that is known to survive in the church in 1925. Maybe they could daisy-chain it through the ages if needed. Worst-case, one of the PCs may be able to help Grover repair his vortex manipulator and get them back to 1925. 1788 El Pueblo de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora la Reina de los \u00c1ngeles was established in 1781. It\u2019s a small village at this point, only about 50 people. Some are soldiers, some Catholic Missionaries, and some settlers (pobladores). The whole region is called Alta California under Spanish rule. The current alcalde (mayor) is Jos\u00e9 Vanegas, one of the original settlers. They live right next to Yaanga, and the natives are pretty much helping the settlers survive. The settlers are a mixed bag of Spaniards, natives, Africans, Mexican-born Spaniards, and every combination of the above. So mostly \u201cbrown.\u201d There\u2019s some social stratification, but not anything like what\u2019s seen in the United States. Who\u2019s here? Antonio Juarez and Mary Harbeson are the Angel victims in 1788. Antonio was a waiter at a local restaurant. He was zapped in the alley behind the restaurant while closing late one night. He\u2019s also Rupert Cavanaugh\u2019s lover. He\u2019s of Mexican descent, so he has a pretty good idea of when he is, but has no idea how he got here. He\u2019s very practical, and knows he won\u2019t have any descendents, so he might as well stay here. He may connect with a native guy, as they have no taboos against homosexuality (but the Catholic settlers sure do). He\u2019ll want to know that Rupert is OK, but he never viewed it as a stable relationship anyway. Mary is an aspiring actress originally from upstate New York, although not a wealthy family. She came out here to get famous, and lived in the same women\u2019s boarding house as Ellie Mae, but she got zapped before Ellie moved in. She doesn\u2019t know jack about history, but Antonio has given her a crash course. She\u2019s learning Spanish, and nobody seems to mind her, as all the pobladores are in the \u201cpull your weight\u201d stage. She\u2019s white, which makes her high-status in the pueblo, so she\u2019ll probably marry well and be all right. How can the PCs leave a message for 1925? If the PCs try to send a message to the future, they could: Bury something on the site of the church, if they have any way of knowing where it is. Bury something beneath where the Hollywood sign will be. Bury something in one of the government buildings or churches in this area at the time. Leaving anything with the natives is likely to be futile, as they\u2019ll be wiped out soon enough. 1865 Basically, this era is terrible. The US took possession of California in 1848, and started treating the natives like crap. Most of them are either alcoholic or ill, and they have no legal status as citizens. The Civil War didn\u2019t really touch this area, although California was a Union state. There were sympathizers of both sides in the area, including a strong Confederate presence, even after the war. There were heavy rains and flooding in 1862, and a smallpox epidemic in 1864. Regardless, Americans start coming west in significant numbers. Hollywood is basically a cowboy town, largely lawless, with all sorts coming through. Cowboys, gold miners, rancheros, drifters, people looking to escape. Nobody asks too many questions. Who\u2019s here? Billy Joe Westcott Billy Joe is Ellie Mae\u2019s older brother. He got zapped back here when he tried to confront Wainwright about his organized crime links and blackmail him into giving Ellie Mae a job. Turns out he was badly wrong; Wainwright\u2019s links are with the Angels, and they \u201cgot rid\u201d of Billy for him. Billy\u2019s not aware of any other victims being here, but they likely either disappeared into the woodwork, or didn\u2019t last long. How can the PCs leave a message for 1925? Hang on, kids. This is where things get complicated. Billy Joe is known as Reverend Gainesworth in 1925, and he knows about the Angels then. However, the PCs may not have encountered him yet. If they have, you can set up a nice causal loop scenario, where Billy Joe gets the information from the PCs in 1865, and then imparts that same information to them in 1925. If not, he has to get it somehow, so we\u2019ll recruit another time traveler to tell him. If the PCs have already met Billy in 1925, as Reverend Gainesworth: Billy knows nothing about the Angels or how he got here. The PCs will have to tell him to build the church and pass the information to them in 1925, closing the time loop. Billy may not want to do that, but causality says he has no choice. If the PCs haven\u2019t met Billy in 1925, or don\u2019t have info about the Angels yet: Billy was given some cryptic info by a strange man with an English accent, wearing a tweed blazer and a bow tie, and with truly idiotic hair. He needs to build the church and wait for his sister to turn up, but he can\u2019t say where he got this information until the PCs already know. How do the PCs get back? If the PCs have been Angel-zapped, you\u2019ll need a way to reunite them at the end of the story (or before, if they go that route). There are a few ways you can do this. Los Angeles isn\u2019t a heavily polluted timeline like New York in the 1930s is, so just popping back to pick someone up is an option. Some variations: If you\u2019ve got a Doctor or other Time Lord capable of steering the TARDIS with precision, just figure out when they are and go get them. If the lost PCs haven\u2019t sent a message forward with a precise date, use one of the options in the next bullet. If this is a Doctor or Time Lord without the ability to pilot a TARDIS accurately, you can still track down the lost PCs: If the Doctor or Time Lord knows what the Angels are, they can issue the PCs with \u201ctime tracers,\u201d small items that will allow the TARDIS to find them again. If time tracers are unrealistic in your scenario, have the TARDIS track the PCs\u2019 \u201cartron energy trace\u201d back to where they are. If there\u2019s no TARDIS in the scenario, and you\u2019re doing an \u201cunstuck in time\u201d or \u201crandom time hopping effect,\u201d have the PCs come unstuck again from where they are, and reunite them with the rest of the group at the beginning of the next story. Tracking down the lost party members could be the next adventure. Beware of having the PCs separated for too long with no communication. You don\u2019t want a player sitting at the table but unable to do anything for too long. Alternatively, if a player needs to take an extended break, or wants to start a new character, their old character could decide to stay in the time period where they\u2019re stuck, either temporarily or permanently. Tips for the GM Try not to tell the players the title of the story until after they\u2019ve encountered the Angels. Or if you do, mention it casually, without tipping your hand that Weeping Angels are involved. There are several hints that the Angels are the bad guys \u2013 Our Lady of the Angels church, Celestial Studios, and Los Angeles itself \u2013 but if you don\u2019t emphasize it, odds are your players won\u2019t notice, because they\u2019ll be focused on the Hollywood story. Even if one or more players figures it out in advance, don\u2019t worry about it; simply proceed as if the players don\u2019t know until the big reveal. If necessary, remind the players of the difference between what the players know and what the characters know. If, like my group, you have some players who are familiar with the Angels and some who aren\u2019t, you can use this for an info-dump . If one of the PCs is from the present day, that\u2019s your excuse. The Doctor wasn\u2019t at all quiet about the Wester Drumlins incident; this easter egg is on 17 publicly available DVDs, and has been the subject of a lot of speculation on easter egg forums (\u201cThe Angels Have the Phone Box\u201d is sold on t-shirts). This video tells players what they need to know while also being cryptic, spooky, and completely vague about what happened at Wester Drumlins. Personally, I suspect that UNIT or Torchwood would have confiscated the Angels and razed the house; it\u2019s up to you whether a PC would know that. The Angels are a GM\u2019s gift, because they let you control the pacing of Part 2, and you can keep the tension high. Any time the players stall the action by arguing about which way to go, start a counter, either in your head or in front of the players. When you want them to get a move on, an Angel appears. If they\u2019re going someplace you don\u2019t want them to, an Angel blocks their way. Remember that the Angels are an obstacle to avoid, not an instant-kill booby trap. It\u2019s important to play fair, within reason. An Angel shouldn\u2019t sneak up behind the PCs and tag one with no warning. They also shouldn\u2019t be in places they can\u2019t possibly be. For example, if players have just looked at all three Angels behind them, those Angels can get closer, but can\u2019t suddenly appear in front of them. However, if an Angel is out of sight of the PCs for more than a blink, it can easily \u201cmove around the far side\u201d to get in front of the PCs. This only works, though, in relatively enclosed spaces, preferably with lots of corners. In the open, the Angels are at a disadvantage. NPC Stats As written, this story leans more toward talking and exploration, with not a lot of direct conflict. The Angels don't have stats, by design, as they're more obstacles than anything. However, the PCs may find themselves in a verbal or social conflict with a named NPC, so these stat blocks are provided for your convenience.

But not everything in Hollywood is glitzy and glamorous: Many aspiring men and women have come to Hollywood to join the movie industry, only to find themselves out of luck. Often destitute, they\u2019ll take any job they can, which makes them easy marks for unscrupulous business types, whether connected to the movie industry or otherwise. Drug use and alcoholism is rampant, even though Prohibition is the law of the land. The Los Angeles police are famously corrupt in this era, and as Hollywood is far from the center of the city, the area is poorly patrolled. Many studios, especially newer ones, are funded by organized crime, some more or less openly.

Everybody else thinks that Billy Joe went home, or left town with a girl, but Ellie Mae doesn\u2019t believe that of her brother. With nowhere else to turn, she\u2019ll ask the PCs for help. Billy Joe and others are going missing because Celestial Studios is harboring a group of Weeping Angels, an offshoot of the ones seen in New York in the episode \u201cThe Angels Take Manhattan.\u201d Alastair Wainwright, owner of Celestial, has an uneasy alliance with the Angels: they can remove his competition, in exchange for shelter and a regular source of \u201cfood.\u201d However, Celestial hasn\u2019t successfully made any films yet, and the Angels have to supplement their diet by doing some hunting on their own. This is giving Celestial a creepy reputation, making people not want to work there, which perpetuates the cycle. The Angels\u2019 long-term plan, which Wainwright doesn\u2019t know, is to appear in the background of films distributed around the country and around the world.

With some careful pacing, you can have the PCs discover the Angels right at the end of Act One, for a great cliffhanger. The primary responsibilities for the GM in Act One are to control the pace and set the atmosphere. Hollywood by day is sun-washed and hot, full of beautiful people and colorful characters all engaged in the business of telling made-up stories. Even if Ellie May hasn\u2019t found stardom yet, she\u2019s sure it\u2019s just around the corner. The effect should be of a magical place where anything is possible. Even the speakeasy (if you use that set) should be a \u201cCheers\u201d-like saloon operating more or less openly, clean and friendly, a place where you\u2019d want to spend your lunch hour or some time after work with friends. This sets up the contrast to Celestial Studios, which should be dark and creepy, as much as possible like the Wester Drumlins house from \u201cBlink.\u201d Hopefully the PCs investigate at night, but even if they manage to get in during daylight, emphasize that the place is understaffed, full of shadowy corners. The various buildings and warehouses are close together, forming a network of narrow alleys. Random sets and equipment make it easy to get lost.

If the party doesn\u2019t include the Doctor, but includes any Earthlings, especially ones from the modern era, the urge to explore Hollywood will likely be enough on its own.

Her brother Billy Joe is a year older than her, and encouraged her to follow her dream, so they both came out to Hollywood, without their parents\u2019 approval. Billy Joe doesn\u2019t seem to have leading-man potential, so he does odd jobs as a day laborer, and as an extra when he can get it.

Unfortunately, Rupert isn\u2019t terribly successful, and is banking on Ellie\u2019s star power to boost both their careers. Despite rumors of how men behave in Hollywood, Rupert has never been inappropriate toward Ellie; he\u2019s absolutely professional, and she trusts him. Billy Joe disappeared three days ago, with no word, and no message. Ellie thinks this is very unlike him. She knows that Rupert believes he ran off with a girl, but Ellie knows he wouldn\u2019t leave her like that. Rupert has arranged an audition at Celestial Studios in the next few days. It\u2019s the best lead he or Ellie have had yet, and he wants her concentrating on that. Basil and Rick are also in the speakeasy, and Charlie is behind the bar. Either Basil or Rick is likely to stick their nose into this conversation, depending on how you want to play it. Basil wants to show off that he\u2019s got connections, and will play coy until the PCs buy him a drink. Rick is more sympathetic to Ellie, but also more likely to agree with Rupert\u2019s supposition. Play the dialog however seems most fun and natural to you, but the PCs should learn the following: Billy Joe has been seen talking with people known to be involved in organized crime. Billy Joe believes that Wainwright has mob ties, and thinks he has enough leverage to blackmail Wainwright into hiring Ellie and Rupert. Billy Joe was seen around Celestial Studios a few days ago, but that\u2019s the last anyone has seen of him. If the players investigate further, or do really well in their interactions in the bar, they may learn that Billy Joe isn\u2019t the only disappearance. It\u2019s hard to tell in Hollywood, because people come and go all the time, and half of them aren\u2019t using their real names or backgrounds. But several of the disappearances are either people who had connections to Celestial, or were in the geographic area. If any of the NPCs have given it much thought, they\u2019d assume that Wainwright\u2019s supposed mob connections allow him to order people \u201cdisappeared.\u201d","title":"Lunch and Explanations"},{"location":"doctorwhorpg/cityofangels/#whos-who","text":"Colin Thompson , local police. Stereotypical Irish cop. 40s, balding, bit paunchy. Sweats a lot because he\u2019s an Irishman in Southern California. If you need someone to chase the PCs away from the sign, or to provide info and directions once they\u2019re in town, Colin\u2019s your guy. He\u2019s a beat cop, but not likely to chase anyone down, because he\u2019s not in good enough shape for that. Can be on the take if the story needs him to be. Won\u2019t investigate Celestial if asked; there are too many rumors about that place and its owner. Ellie Mae Westcott , aspiring actress looking for her brother. Early to mid 20s, tall, thin but shapely, with blonde hair she wears in a stylish flapper\u2019s cut. Goes by \u201cRita Swanson\u201d as a stage name. She\u2019s got girl-next-door charm, and when she wants to, she\u2019s got poise and presence that can knock most people back on their heels. When she\u2019s in stage mode, she has a mostly neutral accent with just a hint of New York in it. When she forgets, or when she\u2019s around people she trusts, the act drops and she\u2019s a gentle Southern girl with a pronounced Alabama accent. She\u2019s got Cavanaugh\u2019s patronage, and despite appearances, the relationship is entirely professional. That association is keeping her from working for any other studios. She lives at a local boarding house for aspiring actresses. Rupert Cavanaugh , a director who believes Ellie Mae has potential. He\u2019s in his early 30s, slender, heavily Pomaded black hair. A sharp dresser, although on closer inspection, his clothes have seen better days. He\u2019s had fallings-out with other studio bosses, and learned the hard way not to have opinions. He\u2019s trying to get a job with Wainwright now because he wants to keep working. May provide some info, but not willing to take any risks. Despite what the PC\u2019s may assume, doesn\u2019t have any ill intentions toward Ellie Mae. He\u2019s gay, but that\u2019s one thing you can\u2019t be in Hollywood at this time, so he doesn\u2019t want anyone to know. One of the other victims was his lover, but he\u2019s keeping his head down about that too. Basil Oakhurst , aspiring screenwriter, stereotypical English snot. Mid-30s, but looks older. Starting to bald, doesn\u2019t care. Extremely thin, nose like the prow of a ship. Wears tweed. Can be found at the speakeasy, with his portable typewriter and a drink. He must have money back home, because he hasn\u2019t sold a script yet, but can afford to keep drinking. Looks down on everybody, including himself, but has a soft spot for Ellie Mae because she\u2019s genuine. Won\u2019t talk about himself, but is a good source of gossip about literally anything else. A good source for revealing that Billy tried to blackmail Wainwright. Charlie Wu , a bartender at the local speakeasy. He\u2019s from Fresno, Jack. Doesn\u2019t want trouble in his place. Pays off the cops regularly so he can operate more-or-less in the open. Sells sandwiches to patrons who haven\u2019t had a lot to eat lately. He\u2019s no soft touch; any one of these shmoes could be the next Clark Gable. Rick McHenry , newspaper reporter. 20s, skinny, disheveled, cheap suit. Needs a shave. He\u2019s here to get an interview with Buster Keaton, but has been blocked at every turn. He\u2019s pretending he\u2019s with the Chicago Tribune, but he\u2019s actually a stringer. Another good source of information if the PCs need it. Reverend Horton Gainesworth , an elderly preacher, sole staff of Our Lady of the Angels. The epitome of the word \u201cgrizzled.\u201d Tall, but stooped now. Uses a cane, but just as much for shaking at people as for support. Black priest garb, none too clean. Thinning gray hair that needs a brush; he\u2019s either trying to grow a beard unsuccessfully, or he really needs a shave. Can often be found on the front steps of the church, fulminating about sin and how depraved the town is getting. A known source of refuge for those who have nowhere else to go, but that doesn\u2019t mean he has to be nice about it. Spoilers: Rev. Gainesworth is actually Billy Joe Westcott, Ellie May\u2019s brother. He was born in 1902, came to Hollywood with Ellie Mae, got angel-zapped to 1865, and simply stayed in the area until his sister showed up. He appears mad, which he may be, after all he\u2019s been through, but he\u2019s also not sure what to do without disrupting the timeline. Having all sorts of mixed-up feelings about contacting his sister again. Knows a lot about the Angels, but won\u2019t reveal himself to Ellie Mae or the PCs until after their first encounter with the Angels. Trying to save his younger self or stop the PCs from encountering the Angels will result in a paradox, and he\u2019s been warned not to do that (by the PCs if the opportunity arises; by a strange man in a bow tie if not). Alastair Wainwright , owner of Celestial Studios. Mid 50s, stereotypical rich guy, white fringe of hair, thin mustache that he thinks makes him look better than it does. Overweight for the era, more \u201cround\u201d by modern standards. Finely dressed, a couple of expensive-looking rings. Cigar smoker. Alastair knows what the Angels are and has an idea of what they do. How he found out and exactly what he\u2019s getting out of the deal are best left vague. He knows that the Angels want to be filmed and distributed, but doesn\u2019t know what that will mean. At the moment, while he appears to be working on a few movies, he\u2019s spending most of his energy on developing new, lighter cameras and film, with some vague assist from the Angels. If anybody questions him or pokes too hard into his business, they tend to disappear. This has led to assumptions of organized crime connections, but it\u2019s actually the Angels. Gabe Hernandez , props wrangler at Celestial Studios. 40s, short and stocky, male-pattern baldness, nervous expression. Wears a work shirt and overalls. If the players need an excuse to explore the props room once they\u2019re inside the studio, they can overhear Gabe arguing with Wainwright. Gabe is upset that the previous props master left, and doesn\u2019t want to go in the storage room. Wainwright tells him he\u2019ll go or be fired. After, Gabe will wring his hands in the hallway for a while, then run off. Guido and Luigi , thugs working for Wainwright, under orders to prevent anybody unauthorized poking around the studio. They believe Wainwright\u2019s lie that he\u2019s working on revolutionary tech, but they don\u2019t really care all that much. Neither of them talk much; they\u2019re giant slabs of muscle in ill-fitting suits.","title":"Who\u2019s Who"},{"location":"doctorwhorpg/cityofangels/#the-victims","text":"The following people are among the missing.

They\u2019ll need some way to investigate: They can wait until nightfall and simply break in. If they have any kind of technology from later than 1925, this shouldn\u2019t be difficult. Ellie Mae won\u2019t want to accompany them unless specifically requested. She\u2019s never been inside and has no information that would help. She\u2019ll stay at her boarding house. They could wait and try to accompany Ellie and Rupert to the audition. This will take some explaining, as Ellie shouldn\u2019t have much of an entourage at this point, and Rupert won\u2019t want any extraneous people there who might screw up his chances. They could fake a legitimate business reason to be there during daylight. They might pretend to be reporters who want to interview Wainwright, actors or screenwriters who want to talk to him, or maybe just laborers looking for a job. If they try any of these, Guido will block them at the front gate and inform them that Mr. Wainwright is occupied and not seeing visitors. The PCs could try any number of Doctor-Who -ish solutions to bluff, charm, or distract Guido, but it\u2019ll be difficult; this is his job, after all. Overpowering him is near impossible, and would be noticed on the street at mid-day. You can tweak the circumstances to encourage the PCs to come back at night to break in. Inside Celestial, the PCs can find the following: The back of the studio is a solid wooden fence along a narrow alley, with a swinging wooden gate wide enough for flatbed trucks. This is where the studio takes its shipments, but it\u2019s also the perfect place to break in, either by picking the lock or scaling the fence. Immediately inside the back gate is a dirt lot where loading and unloading takes place. During the day, there will be some laborers moving crates around. At night, it\u2019s empty. There are several warehouse-type buildings around the lot (except for the side against the fence), with narrow alleys between them, shadowed even during the day. Wainwright\u2019s office is at the front of the complex, facing the street. During the day, Wainwright will be here. He knows about the Angels and their plan, but doesn\u2019t know how catastrophic that would be. He\u2019ll tell the PCs they have no business here, and if they go to the police, no one will believe them. If they try to get rough, he\u2019ll sic Guido and Luigi on them. At night, Wainwright won\u2019t be here, but the PCs can find in the paperwork: Evidence of movie distribution deals, still being negotiated Evidence of payments from New York shell companies including Grayle Collections, Heavenly Produce, and Winter Quay No evidence of organized crime connections A screening room: basically a rectangular room with some chairs, a screen, and a projector. Before the cliffhanger, the room is empty with no film on the projector. A soundstage, where filming is taking place, or done for the day, depending on the time. There\u2019s a large, heavy camera set up pointing at a stage that has some set dressing on it: some fake trees, a couple of tombstones, and a crumbling wall with ivy on it. There\u2019s a plinth that might hold a statue, currently empty. Film storage: A room full of cans containing film reels. On a successful Knowledge roll, a character with a background in chemistry or film history will know this is early celluloid, which is extremely flammable. Near the props storage during the day, Gabe Hernandez. He got promoted on Mac\u2019s disappearance, but he\u2019s terrified to go near the props storage again. He\u2019ll help if the PCs are kind to him. Props storage: This is a large warehouse full of stage dressing, and essentially junk. If it\u2019s night, entice the PCs in here by having the door open, and a flickering light from inside. Inside, there\u2019s a single bulb casting shadows everywhere. If it\u2019s daytime, a few dirty windows near the roof-line let in murky daylight. Either way, there\u2019s enough light to make out what\u2019s in here: Bits of wall made of wood, but painted to look like brick or stone; fake plants with cloth leaves; a chariot with a broken wheel; some statues; a few large urns painted to look Greek; the base of a fountain with no water. Once the PCs enter props storage, mention the \u201cstatues of various figures\u201d in the middle of the description. If the PCs investigate further, they\u2019ll notice that most of the statues are cheap plaster. Some are Greek heroes or athletes, there\u2019s a headless Winged Victory of Samothrace, and in the back, two figures with folded wings, floor-length robes, and hands over their faces. These are the Weeping Angels, but hopefully you won\u2019t have to tell the players that, because they\u2019ll figure it out for themselves and be too busy shouting. If you can time it correctly, immediately after discovering the Angels is a great place for a cliffhanger, either ending the episode, or for a mid-session break.","title":"Investigating Celestial Studios"},{"location":"doctorwhorpg/cityofangels/#act-two-angels-among-us","text":"At this point, the PCs should have investigated Celestial far enough to find the Angels in the props storage.

If you have a large number of players, more than 4 or 5, you may want to add another Angel or two, just to make it harder for the PCs to immobilize them all at once.

The Angels can move pretty much wherever they want when the PCs aren\u2019t looking, so they could be behind, ahead, or down side corridors. However, there are only three, so you\u2019ll need to keep track of where they are. Make this as claustrophobic as possible. Angels can appear down the end of corridors, or inside rooms as the PCs go by. As long as the PCs keep a lookout, the Angels can\u2019t actually get them. The section \u201cDon\u2019t Blink!\u201d below provides mechanical advice on how to interact with the Angels. The Angels will generally try to herd the PCs into a place where they\u2019re cornered. However, Celestial doesn\u2019t have too many dead ends. There\u2019s lots of corridors, but they usually connect up and lead somewhere. If the PCs don\u2019t dally, watch for Angels, and generally try to get out of there, they should make it. If the PCs have time-travel tech, or even a TARDIS key, the Angels are going to want it, and they\u2019ll home in on whichever PC has it. If the PCs split up, the Angels will follow the ones with the strongest time-energy signature. If one of the PCs is a Time Lord, they\u2019re the target. If not, the Angels will be drawn to whichever PC is the furthest from their home time period. One exception, mostly because it\u2019s great for atmosphere: the screening room. If the players discovered it during Part 1, the room was empty. If they find it now, it\u2019s still empty of people, but there\u2019s a reel on the projector. If the players barricade themselves in the room, the Angels will rattle the door for a few seconds, then stop. A few seconds after that, the projector will turn on, showing a static image of the soundstage with an Angel in the center of the shot. If the PCs look away at all, the Angel will move \u201ccloser\u201d to the screen. If the PCs ignore the Angel, it\u2019ll eventually emerge from the screen. (\u201cThat which holds the image of an Angel is also an Angel.\u201d) If the PCs shut off the projector, it\u2019ll turn itself back on after a couple of seconds. If they unplug the projector, it\u2019ll still turn back on after a couple of seconds, even unplugged. Only cutting the film or removing it from the projector will stop the image. This encounter is useful to draw out the chase and give the players a chance to breathe for just a second, before ramping the tension back up and making the scene even creepier. If the PCs run off the lot and back into the city, the Angels will follow, but not too far. Even in 1925, there are streetlights, and it\u2019s not so late yet that the Angels won\u2019t be seen. Depending on where the PCs go, the Angels may appear in alleyways, but not out in the open.","title":"Escaping Celestial"},{"location":"doctorwhorpg/cityofangels/#dont-blink","text":"The Doctor Who RPG rules don\u2019t give stats for Weeping Angels, and that\u2019s a good thing. These aren\u2019t baddies you can fight physically. They\u2019re faster than the PCs and impervious to harm. If the PCs try things that would normally break a stone statue, like hitting it with a hammer, they\u2019ll discover that the Angels are incredibly tough, much more than even stone. You don\u2019t want the PCs to win this through brute force; they\u2019ll need to be clever. However, the PCs should know how to freeze an Angel, or find out real quick. If you put Weeping Angels in a story, expect the players to want to not-blink at them; this is part of the fun! You want it to work, so the PCs have some recourse, but you also need the players to know that simply declaring that they keep an Angel immobilized by staring at it is tougher than it sounds. To keep an Angel frozen by staring at it: Awareness + Resolve. Start at difficulty 9, easy. Each round, bump the difficulty by 3. Be sure to describe the PC\u2019s sensation of their eyes getting dry, a desire to look anywhere else, and eventually the burning need to blink. Bump the difficulty by a lot if an Angel extinguishes a light or puts a lot of dust in the air. If the player succeeds, the Angel stays where it is, but the player can only move very slowly, and can\u2019t lose line of sight. If the player fails, the PC blinks and the Angel moves closer. Remember to tell the player that they can\u2019t see the Angel move. It\u2019s simply closer than it was before, in the literal blink of an eye. Especially in the beginning of the encounter, let the player have two or three failures before the Angel is close enough to touch. To spot an Angel: Awareness + Ingenuity (the standard Notice roll). Difficulty 12 if the Angel is chasing, 15 if it\u2019s hiding. Adjust the difficulty depending on the ambient light, and how much you want to ratchet the tension. To find a hiding Angel you know is there: Awareness + Subterfuge or Survival. Difficulty 18. In pitch darkness, 24. Remember: The purpose of these rules is to let the GM control the pacing and the tension, not to insta-kill the PCs just because they got a bad roll. Angel-zapping a PC will take the story in a whole new direction (see \u201cTouched by an Angel\u201d below), so it should carry some dramatic weight if it happens. If the PCs insist on continuing to investigate Celestial even knowing the Angels are there, ratchet up the threat and bring the Angels closer. You know your players and the tone you\u2019re trying to provide, so it\u2019s up to you where to set the threshold for Angel-zapping. The players may trap themselves in a corner with no way to escape. If the players decide that knowing how to freeze the Angels makes them safe, and they can continue as they were, well, you know what happens in Doctor Who to characters who get arrogant and complacent.","title":"Don\u2019t Blink!"},{"location":"doctorwhorpg/cityofangels/#encountering-ellie-mae-again","text":"The PCs might run to Ellie Mae\u2019s boarding house.

If the PCs can get them to look at one another, that\u2019s effective enough to go on with. The PCs can take advantage of a few ways to trick the Angels into looking at each other, or themselves: There are plenty of mirrors around, because it\u2019s a movie studio The PCs could also trick them into watching their own image on film If the PCs have the Angels immobilized (looking at each other, or just enough PCs keeping an eye on them), they\u2019ll be able to transport the Angels without too much trouble. The studio has flatbed trucks and cranes for moving large pieces of sets around. If it\u2019s not feasible to get equipment from Celestial, there are plenty of other places in Hollywood that rent equipment to studios. Don\u2019t let the plot become bogged down because the PCs can\u2019t get a truck. To get rid of them permanently, the PCs need to stick them someplace where they won\u2019t be found again for a very long time, like geological time. They could dump them in: A big ravine: There are plenty of steep canyons and dry riverbeds in the area, some of which will still be uninhabited for decades. You don\u2019t need to find a precise real-world location; just make up a cave in a canyon nearby, or have an NPC suggest it. The ocean: The Pacific is conveniently nearby, and it doesn\u2019t take long to get to an area deep enough that a few statues won\u2019t be spotted for a very long time. Keeping the Angels immobilized isn\u2019t a huge problem; somebody just has to stare at them until they sink out of sight. Stone Angels aren\u2019t known for their swimming skills. The construction site: the Hollywoodland housing development where the PCs arrived has a number of options for burying Angels. Houses in California don\u2019t have basements, but they do have foundations. Mulholland Drive and environs will one day be some of the most sought-after addresses in Hollywood. Strategically, it\u2019s not the best solution, because construction in the area, or landslides, could easily free the Angels in the future. Thematically, though, it would be fun to suggest that some of Hollywood\u2019s most famous stars live in houses built atop buried Angels. You could even use it as a hook for a sequel story. The La Brea Tar Pits: this famous Los Angeles site is only a few miles from Hollywood, making it more convenient than a ravine or the ocean. It exists in this era -- excavations started in 1913 \u2013 but it\u2019s not yet a big tourist attraction, so you can find a time when no one is around to dump some statues there. This option really takes advantage of the L.A. flavor, and makes a great image as the Angels sink slowly into the muck. Plus, the players will feel very clever if they think of this option themselves. Getting rid of the film-duplicate Angels is easy, because celluloid burns. In fact, you can get it hot enough to burn with the light from a film projector. Although a massive fire won\u2019t destroy the Angels, it will nicely take out Celestial and any remaining evidence. History doesn\u2019t record a massive fire in Hollywood at that time, but a fire big enough to put a studio out of business for good?

The Chumash are an equally powerful and advanced tribe to the northwest, and a trading partner to the Tongva. The Tongva also occupy Catalina Island and the other islands in the bay. Spanish and Mexican explorers have reached the area by this time, but there are no permanent settlements. So the Tongva won\u2019t be surprised by pale-skinned humans wearing strange clothing. There may be a convenient Spanish explorer here (call him Diego) if the PCs don\u2019t have translator microbes. The Tongva believe in a \u201cweb of life,\u201d of which humans are just one part.

Mr. Wainwright shot a lot of footage of props and scenery, but there didn\u2019t seem to be any scripts yet, or actors or directors assigned. He had acquired lots of stage dressing from a Broadway company that went bankrupt (which is how the Angels got out here from the Manhattan colony). Other people didn\u2019t want to go into props storage because it creeped them out. Mac didn\u2019t get it, but now he knows why. He\u2019s mid-40s, a smoker, and won\u2019t survive more than another couple of decades. Grover seems to be a drifter who got zapped in an alley because an Angel got hungry.

Mac or Grover might be able to suggest a relic that is known to survive in the church in 1925. Maybe they could daisy-chain it through the ages if needed.

This is where things get complicated. Billy Joe is known as Reverend Gainesworth in 1925, and he knows about the Angels then. However, the PCs may not have encountered him yet. If they have, you can set up a nice causal loop scenario, where Billy Joe gets the information from the PCs in 1865, and then imparts that same information to them in 1925. If not, he has to get it somehow, so we\u2019ll recruit another time traveler to tell him. If the PCs have already met Billy in 1925, as Reverend Gainesworth: Billy knows nothing about the Angels or how he got here. The PCs will have to tell him to build the church and pass the information to them in 1925, closing the time loop. Billy may not want to do that, but causality says he has no choice. If the PCs haven\u2019t met Billy in 1925, or don\u2019t have info about the Angels yet: Billy was given some cryptic info by a strange man with an English accent, wearing a tweed blazer and a bow tie, and with truly idiotic hair.

There are a few ways you can do this. Los Angeles isn\u2019t a heavily polluted timeline like New York in the 1930s is, so just popping back to pick someone up is an option. Some variations: If you\u2019ve got a Doctor or other Time Lord capable of steering the TARDIS with precision, just figure out when they are and go get them. If the lost PCs haven\u2019t sent a message forward with a precise date, use one of the options in the next bullet. If this is a Doctor or Time Lord without the ability to pilot a TARDIS accurately, you can still track down the lost PCs: If the Doctor or Time Lord knows what the Angels are, they can issue the PCs with \u201ctime tracers,\u201d small items that will allow the TARDIS to find them again. If time tracers are unrealistic in your scenario, have the TARDIS track the PCs\u2019 \u201cartron energy trace\u201d back to where they are. If there\u2019s no TARDIS in the scenario, and you\u2019re doing an \u201cunstuck in time\u201d or \u201crandom time hopping effect,\u201d have the PCs come unstuck again from where they are, and reunite them with the rest of the group at the beginning of the next story. Tracking down the lost party members could be the next adventure. Beware of having the PCs separated for too long with no communication. You don\u2019t want a player sitting at the table but unable to do anything for too long. Alternatively, if a player needs to take an extended break, or wants to start a new character, their old character could decide to stay in the time period where they\u2019re stuck, either temporarily or permanently.","title":"How do the PCs get back?"},{"location":"doctorwhorpg/cityofangels/#tips-for-the-gm","text":"Try not to tell the players the title of the story until after they\u2019ve encountered the Angels. Or if you do, mention it casually, without tipping your hand that Weeping Angels are involved. There are several hints that the Angels are the bad guys \u2013 Our Lady of the Angels church, Celestial Studios, and Los Angeles itself \u2013 but if you don\u2019t emphasize it, odds are your players won\u2019t notice, because they\u2019ll be focused on the Hollywood story. Even if one or more players figures it out in advance, don\u2019t worry about it; simply proceed as if the players don\u2019t know until the big reveal. If necessary, remind the players of the difference between what the players know and what the characters know. If, like my group, you have some players who are familiar with the Angels and some who aren\u2019t, you can use this for an info-dump . If one of the PCs is from the present day, that\u2019s your excuse. The Doctor wasn\u2019t at all quiet about the Wester Drumlins incident; this easter egg is on 17 publicly available DVDs, and has been the subject of a lot of speculation on easter egg forums (\u201cThe Angels Have the Phone Box\u201d is sold on t-shirts). This video tells players what they need to know while also being cryptic, spooky, and completely vague about what happened at Wester Drumlins. Personally, I suspect that UNIT or Torchwood would have confiscated the Angels and razed the house; it\u2019s up to you whether a PC would know that. The Angels are a GM\u2019s gift, because they let you control the pacing of Part 2, and you can keep the tension high. Any time the players stall the action by arguing about which way to go, start a counter, either in your head or in front of the players. When you want them to get a move on, an Angel appears. If they\u2019re going someplace you don\u2019t want them to, an Angel blocks their way. Remember that the Angels are an obstacle to avoid, not an instant-kill booby trap. It\u2019s important to play fair, within reason. An Angel shouldn\u2019t sneak up behind the PCs and tag one with no warning. They also shouldn\u2019t be in places they can\u2019t possibly be. For example, if players have just looked at all three Angels behind them, those Angels can get closer, but can\u2019t suddenly appear in front of them. However, if an Angel is out of sight of the PCs for more than a blink, it can easily \u201cmove around the far side\u201d to get in front of the PCs. This only works, though, in relatively enclosed spaces, preferably with lots of corners. In the open, the Angels are at a disadvantage.","title":"Tips for the GM"},{"location":"doctorwhorpg/cityofangels/#npc-stats","text":"As written, this story leans more toward talking and exploration, with not a lot of direct conflict.
